Although, better known for its role in inflammation, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) has more recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. This has been, in part, to the discovery of its localization not just in glia, cells that are integral to mediating the inflammatory process in the brain, but also neurons. Several effectors of neuronal NF-κB have been identified, including calcium, inflammatory cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor alpha), and the induction of experimental paradigms thought to reflect learning and memory at the cellular level (i.e., long-term potentiation). NF-κB is also activated after learning and memory formation in vivo. In turn, activation of NF-κB can elicit either suppression or activation of other genes. Studies are only beginning to elucidate the multitude of neuronal gene targets of NF-κB in the normal brain, but research to date has confirmed targets involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell signaling and growth, neurotransmission, redox signaling, and gene regulation. Further, several lines of research confirm dysregulation of NF-κB in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disorder characterized clinically by a profound deficit in the ability to form new memories. AD-related neuropathology includes the characteristic amyloid beta plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles. Although, such neuropathological findings have been hypothesized to contribute to memory deficits in AD, research has identified perturbations at the cellular and synaptic level that occur even prior to more gross pathologies, including transcriptional dysregulation. Indeed, synaptic disturbances appear to be a significant correlate of cognitive deficits in AD. Given the more recently identified role for NF-κB in memory and synaptic transmission in the normal brain, the expansive network of gene targets of NF-κB, and its dysregulation in AD, a thorough understanding of NF-κB-related signaling in AD is warranted and may have important implications for uncovering treatments for the disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive view of our current understanding of the gene targets of this transcription factor in neurons in the intact brain and provide an overview of studies investigating NF-κB signaling, including its downstream targets, in the AD brain as a means of uncovering the basic physiological mechanisms by which memory becomes fragile in the disease."}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug developments and clinical trials (CT) remain vulnerable to problems that undermine research validity. Investigations of CT methods reveal how numerous factors decrease active drug-placebo group differences and increase variance, thereby reducing power to reach statistical significance for outcome measure differences in AD CTs. Such factors include, amongst many, inaccuracy, imprecision, bias, failures to follow or lack of operational protocols for applying CT methods, inter-site variance, and lack of homogeneous sampling using disorder criteria. After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice."}

As a disease of abnormal aging, AD demonstrates oxidative damage at levels that significantly surpass that of elderly controls, which suggests the involvement of additional factor(s). Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria, which are more proficient at producing reactive oxygen species but less so in ATP, are also an early and prominent feature of the disease. Since mitochondria are also vulnerable to oxidative stress, it is likely that a vicious downward spiral involving the interactions between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contributes to the initiation and/or amplification of reactive oxygen species that is critical to the pathogenesis of AD."}

Genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) are associated with an increase in oxidative stress, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved at an early stage of the pathologic cascade. Moreover, oxidative stress is mechanistically and chronologically associated with other key features of AD, namely, metabolic, mitochondrial, metal, and cell-cycle abnormalities. Contrary to the commonly held notion that pathologic hallmarks of AD signify etiology, several lines of evidence now indicate that aggregation of amyloid-beta and tau is a compensatory response to underlying oxidative stress. Therefore, removal of proteinaceous accumulations may treat the epiphenomenon rather than the disease and may actually enhance oxidative damage. Although some antioxidants have been shown to reduce the incidence of AD, the magnitude of the effect may be modified by individual factors such as genetic predisposition (e.g. apolipoprotein E genotype) and habitual behaviors. Because caloric restriction, exercise, and intellectual activity have been experimentally shown to promote neuronal survival through enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses, a combination of dietary regimen of low total calorie and rich antioxidant nutrients and maintaining physical and intellectual activities may ultimately prove to be one of the most efficacious strategies for AD prevention."}

BACKGROUND/AIMS\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Interestingly, muscle mass (MM) and muscle strength (MS) are related to AD. In addition to the muscle profile, brain atrophy is also a prominent feature of AD. There is substantial evidence showing an association between muscle profile and dementia, but the role of the muscle profile and cerebral cortical atrophy within this association is less well understood. The objective of this study was to determine if there is any association between muscle profile and brain regional volume in AD. A secondary objective was to determine whether this relationship continues as the clinical stage of AD progresses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 28 patients with probable AD without weakness. We assessed the patients' basic demographic characteristics, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and brain magnetic resonance images. MM was measured using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MS was assessed in Nm/kg with an isokinetic knee extensor using an isokinetic device at an angular velocity of 60°/s. An automatic analysis program was used for brain regional volumetric measurements. Dementia was divided into two stages: mild and moderate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMS was related to left hippocampal volume ratio. After adjusting for age and cognitive status, the relationship remained. MS did not demonstrate any relationship to any brain regional volume ratio in the mild stage; however, in the moderate stage, it was positively related to both the right and the left hippocampal volume ratio.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings imply a shared underlying pathology relating MS and brain volume and suggest cognitive functional declines through the muscle-brain axis. Further longitudinal studies are needed to find possible and related causes of reduced MS and cortical atrophy in patients with dementia."}

Patients with schizophrenia had a statistically significant reduction in Cr levels as compared with controls; bipolar disorder patients showed no difference in Cr as compared with controls.

Age-associated diseases are rising to pandemic proportions, exposing the need for efficient and low-cost methods to tackle these maladies at symptomatic, behavioral, metabolic, and physiological levels. While nutrition and health are closely intertwined, our limited understanding of how diet precisely influences disease often precludes the medical use of specific dietary interventions. Caloric restriction (CR) has approached clinical application as a powerful, yet simple, dietary modulation that extends both life- and healthspan in model organisms and ameliorates various diseases. However, due to psychological and social-behavioral limitations, CR may be challenging to implement into real life. Thus, CR-mimicking interventions have been developed, including intermittent fasting, time-restricted eating, and macronutrient modulation. Nonetheless, possible side effects of CR and alternatives thereof must be carefully considered. We summarize key concepts and differences in these dietary interventions in humans, discuss their molecular effects, and shed light on advantages and disadvantages."}

BACKGROUND\nAdherence to a Mediterranean diet may improve longevity, but relevant data are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a population-based, prospective investigation involving 22,043 adults in Greece who completed an extensive, validated, food-frequency questionnaire at base line. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed by a 10-point Mediterranean-diet scale that incorporated the salient characteristics of this diet (range of scores, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater adherence). We used proportional-hazards regression to assess the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality, as well as mortality due to coronary heart disease and mortality due to cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index, physical-activity level, and other potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring a median of 44 months of follow-up, there were 275 deaths. A higher degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduction in total mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for death associated with a two-point increment in the Mediterranean-diet score, 0.75 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.87]). An inverse association with greater adherence to this diet was evident for both death due to coronary heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.94]) and death due to cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98]). Associations between individual food groups contributing to the Mediterranean-diet score and total mortality were generally not significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGreater adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a significant reduction in total mortality."}

The study employed a range of strategies to successfully recruit and retain older African American women. These strategies were initially developed based on a review of the literature and the investigators' prior experience. They were modified as the research progressed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore than a quarter of the participants were recruited from outpatient clinics. In-person outreach to health care providers was essential to engage and retain their help in recruiting patients. The research team made it easy and rewarding for women to participate in the study by providing a toll-free phone number, culturally appropriate intervention materials, intervention in the home, and incentives. Developing a relationship of trust with participants and the community was critical throughout the study period. Through the use of these strategies, the target enrollment of 180 women was met with 91% retention rate at the completion of the study.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of multiple strategies can enhance recruitment and retention of rural, older African American women into a research study. Strategies are most effective when they build a relationship of trust with participants and the community and make it easy and rewarding for women to participate."}

This study examined whether higher midlife CRF was prospectively associated with slower atrophy, which in turn was associated with higher late-life CRF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBrain volume by magnetic resonance imaging was determined annually from 1994 to 2003 in 146 participants (M baseline age = 69.6 years). Peak oxygen uptake on a treadmill yielded estimated midlife CRF in 138 and late-life CRF in 73 participants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher midlife CRF was associated with greater middle temporal gyrus, perirhinal cortex, and temporal and parietal white matter, but was not associated with atrophy progression. Slower atrophy in middle frontal and angular gyri was associated with higher late-life CRF, independent of CRF at baseline magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher midlife CRF may play a role in preserving middle and medial temporal volumes in late adulthood.

Innovative dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have recently emerged as alternative approaches that improve markers of aging. Some of these newer strategies might provide benefits for healthy aging with little to no CR and therefore, compared to traditional CR, may be easier to follow. Further to providing an update of CR studies in humans, the present narrative review appraises the influence of these contemporary dietary strategies on mechanisms posited to drive CR-induced longevity in humans, including those involving energy metabolism, oxidative damage, inﬂammation, glucose homeostasis, and functional changes in the neuroendocrine systems.

BACKGROUND\nEnterolignans are important biomarkers of microbiota diversity, with higher levels indicating greater diversity. Diet and inflammation have been shown to play a role in maintaining microbiota diversity. This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) has an impact on levels of urinary enterolignans in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2008. We also carried out construct validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nData came from NHANES 2003-2008. Enterolignans [enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL)] and CRP were assayed from urine and serum specimens, respectively. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores were calculated from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear and logistic regression for enterolignans, and logistic regression for CRP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter multivariable adjustment, higher E-DII scores (i.e., indicating a relatively more pro-inflammatory diet) were associated with lower levels of creatinine-normalized END [beta coefficient (b)DIIquartile4vs1 = - 1.22; 95% CI = - 0.69, - 1.74; Ptrend ≤ 0.001] and ENL (bDIIquartile4vs1 = - 7.80; 95% CI = - 5.33, - 10.26; Ptrend ≤ 0.001). A positive association was also observed when enterolignans were dichotomized based on the cut-off of the 75th percentile value. In this same sample, the E-DII also was associated with CRP ≥ 3 mg/l (ORDIIcontinuous = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05, 1.19).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn these NHANES data, there was an association between E-DII score and enterolignans. This study also provided construct validation of the E-DII using CRP in a nationally representative sample. The results indicate that dietary inflammatory potential is associated with urinary enterolignans, a potential marker for microbiota diversity. However, studies are required to understand the direct association between DII and microbiota."}

Information about HRT use and health events was obtained from two repeated questionnaires in 1989 and 1994. Information about deaths and causes of death from the follow-up period was obtained from the Statistics Finland. Cox's proportional-hazards models were used to calculate risk of death related to the use of HRT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the start of follow-up, 2203 women had used HRT > 5 years, 3945 women < or = 5 years and 5519 women had never used it. During the follow-up, 361 deaths occurred. Compared with non-users of HRT, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death from any cause was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.36) in women who used HRT < or = 5 years and 1.06 (95% CI 0.78-1.46) in women who used HRT > 5 years.

BACKGROUND\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to AD.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine whether several markers of inflammation are associated with cognitive decline in African-American and white well-functioning elders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors studied 3,031 African-American and white men and women (mean age 74 years) enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) were measured at baseline; cognition was assessed with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive decline was defined as a decline of >5 points.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn age-adjusted analyses, participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 or CRP performed nearly 2 points lower (worse) on baseline and follow-up 3MS (p < 0.001 for all) and declined by almost 1 point over the >2 years (p = 0.01 for IL-6 and p = 0.04 for CRP) compared with those in the lowest tertile. After multivariate adjustment, 3MS scores among participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 and CRP were similar at baseline but remained significantly lower at follow-up (p < or = 0.05 for both). Those in the highest inflammatory marker tertile were also more likely to have cognitive decline compared with the lowest tertile for IL-6 (26 vs 20%; age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.69) and for CRP (24 vs 19%; OR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.79) but not for TNFalpha (23 vs 21%; OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43). There was no significant interaction between race and inflammatory marker or between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and inflammatory marker on cognition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSerum markers of inflammation, especially IL-6 and CRP, are prospectively associated with cognitive decline in well-functioning elders. These findings support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to cognitive decline in the elderly."}

The Clinical Dementia Rating scale was used for describing progressive stages of dementia in vignettes that were used in combination with time trade-off questions for valuing the perceived quality of life in these stages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time-trade off values varied considerably across the progressive disease stages. The mean score was 0.82 for mild cognitive impairment, 0.62 for mild dementia, 0.40 for moderate dementia, and 0.25 for severe dementia. In multiple regression analyses, the scores were relatively insensitive to demographic factors like age, gender and self-assessed health.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results showed that the average time trade-off values declined sharply from mild cognitive impairment to progressing stages of dementia. Since there are many methodological challenges involved in measuring health state utilities in mild cognitive impairment and dementia, more research that evaluates different methods would be welcome."}

Recruitment for the genetic study was done in partnership with a Black-owned radio station. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts, guided by the integrated behavior model (IBM), identified self-reported motivations for participating in this care-focused and community-promoted research program. Findings revealed that decisions to enroll were influenced by strong instrumental attitudes regarding learning more about personal health and contributing to future care options for others. Notable normative influences that factored into participants' decisions to enroll in the study included hearing about the study from a respected community media outlet, friends, and family. About one-third of respondents discussed past and current racial discrimination in medical research as an important sociocultural frame within which they thought about participation, suggesting that experiential attitudes play a continuing role in AA's decisions to enroll in medical research studies. Medical researchers seeking to recruit AA participants should collaborate with community partners, combine enrollment opportunities with access to health services, and emphasize the potential for new research to mitigate racial inequalities."}

Background: Past studies have suggested that higher lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) levels in serum and in the central nervous system (as quantified by measuring macular pigment optical density, MPOD) are related to improved cognitive function in older adults. Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p < 0.04), reasoning ability (p < 0.05) and complex attention (p < 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations."}

Almost two-thirds (64%) of the studies originated in the US; more than half (55%) had been published within the previous three years. Based on the evidence reviewed, the most effective telecare interventions appear to be automated vital signs monitoring (for reducing health service use) and telephone follow-up by nurses (for improving clinical indicators and reducing health service use). The cost-effectiveness of these interventions was less certain. There is insufficient evidence about the effects of home safety and security alert systems.

BACKGROUND\nMany Alzheimer's disease patients in clinical practice are on polypharmacy for treatment of comorbidities.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWhile pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs have been relatively well established with corresponding treatment guidelines, many medications and common genotype variants also affect central brain circuits involved in cognitive trajectory, leading to complex pharmacodynamic interactions and a large variability in clinical trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe applied a mechanism-based and ADAS-Cog calibrated Quantitative Systems Pharmacology biophysical model of neuronal circuits relevant for cognition in Alzheimer's disease, to standard-of-care cholinergic therapy with COMTVal158Met, 5-HTTLPR rs25531, and APOE genotypes and with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, all together 9,585 combinations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model predicts a variability of up to 14 points on ADAS-Cog at baseline (COMTVV 5-HTTLPRss APOE 4/4 combination is worst) and a four-fold range for the rate of progression. The progression rate is inversely proportional to baseline ADAS-Cog. Antidepressants, benzodiazepines, first-generation more than second generation, and most antipsychotics with the exception of aripiprazole worsen the outcome when added to standard-of-care in mild cases. Low dose second-generation benzodiazepines revert the negative effects of risperidone and olanzapine, but only in mild stages. Non APOE4 carriers with a COMTMM and 5HTTLPRLL are predicted to have the best cognitive performance at baseline but deteriorate somewhat faster over time. However, this effect is significantly modulated by comedications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnce these simulations are validated, the platform can in principle provide optimal treatment guidance in clinical practice at an individual patient level, identify negative pharmacodynamic interactions with novel targets and address protocol amendments in clinical trials."}

The microbial community structure of the two models exhibited significant differences compared to the controls, while the two model groups also exhibited significant differences between them. Furthermore, microbial community functional predictions suggested that the two models exhibited different abundances of metabolisms and pathways. Several common and distinct characteristic differences were also observed between the two model groups. Alloprevotella were more abundant in both model groups, while Butyricicoccus, Turicibacter, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto along with the family it belongs to were less abundant relative to controls.

Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of CRF to traditional risk factors significantly improves the reclassification of risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve risk prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for risk classification presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient management and to encourage lifestyle-based strategies designed to reduce cardiovascular risk. These opportunities must be realized to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence meet the American Heart Association's 2020 goals."}

BACKGROUND\nTo examine the effect of multicomponent exercise program on memory function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nSubjects were 100 older adults (mean age, 75 years) with MCI. The subjects were classified to an amnestic MCI group (n = 50) with neuroimaging measures, and other MCI group (n = 50) before the randomization. Subjects in each group were randomized to either a multicomponent exercise or an education control group using a ratio of 1∶1. The exercise group exercised for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, 40 times for 6 months. The exercise program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory. The control group attended two education classes. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that no group × time interactions on the cognitive tests and brain atrophy in MCI patients. A sub-analysis of amnestic MCI patients for group × time interactions revealed that the exercise group exhibited significantly better Mini-Mental State Examination (p = .04) and logical memory scores (p = .04), and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy (p<.05) compared to the control group.

SDLT scores were also significantly lower by 2.38s (P=0.05). Similar results were obtained when tertiles of walnut consumption were examined in trend analyses. Significantly better outcomes were noted in all cognitive test scores among those with higher walnut consumption (P < 0.01). Among adults 60 years and older, walnut consumers averaged 13.1 g/d, scored 7.1 percentile points higher, P=0.03 on the SRT and 7.3 percentile points higher on the DSST, P=0.05. Here also trend analyses indicate significant improvements in all cognitive test scores (P < 0.01) except for SRTT (P = 0.06) in the fully adjusted models.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese significant, positive associations between walnut consumption and cognitive functions among all adults, regardless of age, gender or ethnicity suggest that daily walnut intake may be a simple beneficial dietary behavior."}

Intermittent fasting (IF; reduced meal frequency) and caloric restriction (CR) extend lifespan and increase resistance to age-related diseases in rodents and monkeys and improve the health of overweight humans. Both IF and CR enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity. Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms--reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span."}

BACKGROUND\nIncreasing the proportion of subjects allocated to the experimental treatment in controlled clinical trials is often advocated as a method of increasing recruitment rates and improving the performance of trials. The presumption is that the higher likelihood of randomization to the experimental treatment will be perceived by potential study enrollees as an added benefit of participation and will increase recruitment rates and speed the completion of trials. However, studies with alternative allocation ratios require a larger sample size to maintain statistical power, which may result in a net increase in time required to complete recruitment and a net increase in total trial cost.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo describe the potential net effect of alternative allocation ratios on recruitment time and trial cost.\n\n\nMETHODS\nModels of recruitment time and trial cost were developed and used to compare trials with 1:1 allocation to trials with alternative allocation ratios under a range of per subject costs, per day costs, and enrollment rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn regard to time required to complete recruitment, alternative allocation ratios are net beneficial if the recruitment rate improves by more than about 4% for trials with a 1.5:1 allocation ratio and 12% for trials with a 2:1 allocation ratio. More substantial improvements in recruitment rate, 13 and 47% respectively for scenarios we considered, are required for alternative allocation to be net beneficial in terms of tangible monetary cost.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe cost models were developed expressly for trials comparing proportions or means across treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing alternative allocation ratio designs to improve recruitment may or may not be time and cost-effective. Using alternative allocation for this purpose should only be considered for trial contexts where there is both clear evidence that the alternative design does improve recruitment rates and the attained time or cost efficiency justifies the added study subject burden implied by a larger sample size."}

Higher adherence to MeD was associated with lower likelihood of ICI before (odds ratio [lsqb]OR[rsqb] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [lsqb]CI[rsqb] 0.79-1.00) and after adjustment for potential confounders (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-1.00) including demographic characteristics, environmental factors, vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms, and self-reported health status. There was no interaction between race (p = 0.2928) and association of adherence to MeD with cognitive status. However, we identified a strong interaction of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0134) on the relationship of adherence to MeD with ICI; high adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI in nondiabetic participants (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94; p = 0.0066) but not in diabetic individuals (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.95-1.71; p = 0.1063).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI independent of potential confounders.

AIMS\nA discussion of the existence, prevalence and characteristics of the nocebo effect in health care.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThere is increasing but inconsistent evidence for nocebo effects (the opposite of placebo). Causal mechanisms are believed to be similar to placebo (negative effects result from suggestions of negative clinical outcomes). Risk screening in health care may produce this unintended effect through labelling some patients as high risk. Given health care's almost universal coverage this potentially affects many people.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDiscussion paper following a scoping review of the existence and frequency of nocebo.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nLiterature databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CCTR, CINAHL and EMBASE) searched from inception dates to 2013.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nSignificant empirical evidence indicates that negative beliefs may impact on health outcomes (incidence estimates range from 3-27%). The nocebo effect, rooted in the complex interplay between physiological functioning and social factors, appears significantly more common among women and where prior negative knowledge or expectations exist. Pre-existing psychological characteristics (anxiety, neuroses, panic disorder or pessimism) exacerbate it.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile the placebo effect is well documented, there has been no systematic attempt to synthesize primary empirical research on the role of nocebo. It is possible that nocebo outcomes may be preventable through careful consideration of information provision and the prior identification of potentially high risk individuals. This paper summarizes the scale and importance of the nocebo effect, its distribution according to a range of social and clinical variables and its known relation to psychological precursors. It identifies important gaps in the research literature."}

OBJECTIVES\nThe EQ-5D is a preference-based measure of health and is increasingly being used in the evaluation of health technologies. A 'tariff' of values for all 243 EQ-5D health states has been generated using direct valuations on a subset of these states. The tariff is used to express the value of differences between health states, and so this paper explores whether a tariff with better predictive ability can be calculated using differences between values rather than using the values themselves.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe original tariff (reported in this journal) was based on valuations for 42 EQ-5D states elicited from a representative sample of 2997 members of the UK general population using the time trade-off method. This same data are used to estimate a tariff based upon the differences in value between the worst possible state (33333) and all other states.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA simple model that fits the data well is one in which the differences in value between 33333 and all other states are explained in terms of the change in each dimension plus a term to pick up whether some dimensions change by the maximum amount whereas others do not change at all. The mean absolute difference between the actual values and those predicted by this model is 0.03 (compared with 0.039 in the original model).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe model presented in this paper predicts the difference between 33333 and all other states remarkably well and can be used to generate a tariff for all EQ-5D health states. In fact, this model more accurately predicts the values of states for which there are direct observations, and so we recommend its comparison with the original model in evaluative studies."}

Mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is an intrinsic property of all mitochondria and may have evolved to protect cells against the production of damaging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, compounds that enhance mitochondrial uncoupling are potentially attractive anti-aging therapies; however, chronic ingestion is associated with a number of unwanted side effects. We have previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-directed and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides by causing a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial inefficiency. Here, we sought to leverage the higher therapeutic index of CRMP to test whether mild mitochondrial uncoupling in a liver-directed fashion could reduce oxidative damage and improve age-related metabolic disease and lifespan in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration of CRMP (20 mg/[kg-day] × 4 weeks) reduced hepatic lipid content, protein kinase C epsilon activation, and hepatic insulin resistance in aged (74-week-old) high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J male mice, independently of changes in body weight, whole-body energy expenditure, food intake, or markers of hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis. CRMP treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in hepatic lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and inflammation. Importantly, long-term (49 weeks) hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling initiated late in life (94-104 weeks), in conjugation with HFD feeding, protected mice against neoplastic disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a strain and sex-specific manner. Taken together, these studies illustrate the complex variation of aging and provide important proof-of-concept data to support further studies investigating the use of liver-directed mitochondrial uncouplers to promote healthy aging in humans."}

Previous in vivo studies in humans have shown that parenteral or oral Mg supplementation increase endothelial-dependent vasodilation.

Sixty elderly (≥ 65 years) diabetic patients were recruited (mean age: 71.1 ± 6.1 years; M/F: 35/25). Endothelial function, evaluated by non-invasive flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, as well as anthropometric and laboratory data, including ionized Mg (Mg-ion), were measured in all patients before and after one-month. Thirty patients underwent oral Mg supplementation with 4.5 g/day of Mg pidolate (368 mg/day of Mg ion), while the rest were used as a control group. The usual management of diabetes and hypertension was not changed during the month of study participation for all the patients. In the group of patients that underwent Mg supplementation, Mg-ion concentration significantly increased from 0.42 ± 0.05 mmol/L to 0.49 ± 0.06 mmol/L; p < 0.05. Mg intervention resulted in a significant improvement of the post-ischemic endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (from 3.3 ± 3.6% to 8.4 ± 3.9%; p < 0.05). No significant differences were found, either in ion-Mg or endothelial function, in the control group.

There is epidemiologic and imaging evidence for the presence of cognitive reserve, but the neurophysiologic substrate of CR has not been established. In order to test the hypothesis that CR is related to aspects of neural processing, we used fMRI to image 19 healthy young adults while they performed a nonverbal recognition test. There were two task conditions. A low demand condition required encoding and recognition of single items and a titrated demand condition required the subject to encode and then recognize a larger list of items, with the study list size for each subject adjusted prior to scanning such that recognition accuracy was 75%. We hypothesized that individual differences in cognitive reserve are related to changes in neural activity as subjects moved from the low to the titrated demand task. To test this, we examined the correlation between subjects' fMRI activation and NART scores. This analysis was implemented voxel-wise in a whole brain fMRI dataset. During both the study and test phases of the recognition memory task we noted areas where, across subjects, there were significant positive and negative correlations between change in activation from low to titrated demand and the NART score. These correlations support our hypothesis that neural processing differs across individuals as a function of CR. This differential processing may help explain individual differences in capacity, and may underlie reserve against age-related or other pathologic changes."}

BACKGROUND\nThe metabolic syndrome is thought to be a contributor to coronary heart disease (CHD), and components of the syndrome have been identified as possible therapeutic targets. Previous data implicate neurohumoral activation related to psychosocial stress as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcendental meditation (TM) on components of the metabolic syndrome and CHD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 weeks of TM or active control treatment (health education), matched for frequency and time, at an academic medical center in a total of 103 subjects with stable CHD. Main outcome measures included blood pressure, lipoprotein profile, and insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (calculated as follows: [(fasting plasma glucose level [in milligrams per deciliter] x fasting plasma insulin level [in microunits per milliliter]) x 0.0552]/22.5); endothelial function measured by brachial artery reactivity testing; and cardiac autonomic system activity measured by heart rate variability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe TM group had beneficial changes (measured as mean +/- SD) in adjusted systolic blood pressure (-3.4 +/- 2.0 vs 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg; P = .04), insulin resistance (-0.75 +/- 2.04 vs 0.52 +/- 2.84; P = .01), and heart rate variability (0.10 +/- 0.17 vs -0.50 +/- 0.17 high-frequency power; P = .07) compared with the health education group, respectively. There was no effect of brachial artery reactivity testing.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of TM for 16 weeks in CHD patients improved blood pressure and insulin resistance components of the metabolic syndrome as well as cardiac autonomic nervous system tone compared with a control group receiving health education. These results suggest that TM may modulate the physiological response to stress and improve CHD risk factors, which may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CHD."}

Further, related trials which compare one or other of the treatments of interest with a common third treatment are included in the model to improve inference on both the heterogeneity and the treatment difference. Two approaches to estimating relative efficacy are considered, namely a general parametric approach and a method explicit to binary data. The methodology is illustrated using data from 26 clinical trials which investigate the prevention of cirrhosis using beta-blockers and sclerotherapy.

INTRODUCTION\nIt has been estimated that a 10%-25% reduction in seven key risk factors could potentially prevent 1.1-3.0 million Alzheimer's disease cases globally. In addition, as dementia is preceded by more subtle cognitive deficits which have substantial social and economic impact, effective preventative interventions would likely have more extensive benefits. The current study evaluates in primary care a multidomain risk-reduction intervention targeting adults with high risk of developing dementia.\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted to evaluate three intervention programmes using a pragmatic approach suitable to the clinic: (1) a 12-week online and face-to-face dementia risk-reduction intervention (Body Brain Life-General Practice (BBL-GP)); (2) a 6-week face-to-face group lifestyle modification programme (LMP); and (3) a 12-week email-only programme providing general health information. We aim to recruit 240 participants, aged 18 and over, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline and follow-ups (postintervention, 18, 36 and 62 weeks). The primary outcome is dementia risk measured with the modified version of the Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index Short Form. Secondary outcomes are cognitive function measured with Trails A and B, and the Digit Symbol Modalities Test; physical activity with moderate-vigorous physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; depression with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression; cost evaluation with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score and Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool; diet quality with the Australian Recommended Food Score; and sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThis RCT is a novel pragmatic intervention applied in a primary care setting to reduce the dementia risk exposure in adults at high risk. If successful, BBL-GP and LMP will provide a versatile, evidence-based package that can be easily and quickly rolled out to other primary care settings and which can be scaled up at relatively low cost compared with other strategies involving intensive interventions.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nACTRN12616000868482."}

Importance\nIdentifying modifiable risk factors that are associated with dementia burden across racial and ethnic groups in the population can yield insights into the potential effectiveness of interventions in preventing dementia and reducing disparities.\n\n\nObjective\nTo calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of dementia associated with 12 established modifiable risk factors for all US adults, as well as separately by race and ethnicity.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study used survey data from nationally representative samples of US adults. PAFs were calculated using relative risks and prevalence estimates for 12 risk factors. Relative risks were taken from meta-analyses, as reported in a 2020 systematic review. Prevalence estimates for risk factors were derived from nationally representative cross-sectional survey data collected between 2011 and 2018. Combined PAFs were adjusted for risk factor communality using weights derived from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (1987-2018). Analyses were conducted May through October 2021.\n\n\nExposures\nLow education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and air pollution.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPAF for each dementia risk factor, a combined PAF, and the decrease in the number of prevalent dementia cases in 2020 that would be expected given a 15% proportional decrease in each exposure.\n\n\nResults\nAmong all US adults, an estimated 41.0% (95% CI, 22.7%-55.9%) of dementia cases were attributable to 12 risk factors. A 15% proportional decrease in each risk factor would reduce dementia prevalence in the population by an estimated 7.3% (95% CI, 3.7%-10.9%). The estimated PAF was greater for Black and Hispanic than it was for White and Asian individuals. The greatest attributable fraction of dementia cases was observed for hypertension (PAF, 20.2%; 95% CI, 6.3%-34.4%), obesity (PAF, 20.9%; 95% CI, 13.0%-28.8%), and physical inactivity (PAF, 20.1%; 95% CI, 9.1%-29.6%). These factors were also highest within each racial and ethnic group, although the proportions varied.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nA large fraction of dementia cases in the US were associated with potentially modifiable risk factors, especially for Black and Hispanic individuals. Targeting and reducing these risk factors may curb the projected rise in dementia cases over the next several decades."}

PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nEvidence for the benefit of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease continues to accumulate. Many studies with individual vitamins or supplements show marginal, if any, benefit. However, new findings with combinatorial formulations demonstrate improvement in cognitive performance and behavioral difficulties that accompany Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we review some of the most recent clinical advances and summarize supportive preclinical studies.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nWe present novel positive effects on Alzheimer's disease derived from diet, trace elements, vitamins and supplements. We discuss the inherent difficulty in conducting nutritional studies because of the variance in participants' nutritional history, versus pharmacological interventions in which participants are naive to the intervention. We examine the evidence that epigenetics play a role in Alzheimer's disease and how nutritional intervention can modify the key epigenetic events to maintain or improve cognitive performance.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOverall consideration of the most recent collective evidence suggests that the optimal approach for Alzheimer's disease would seem to combine early, multicomponent nutritional approaches (a Mediterranean-style diet, multivitamins and key combinatorial supplements), along with lifestyle modifications such as social activity and mental and physical exercise, with ultimate addition of pharmacological agents when warranted."}

Data source WHI CaD Study, a seven year, randomised, placebo controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D (1g calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily) in 36,282 community dwelling postmenopausal women. Main outcome measures Incidence of four cardiovascular events and their combinations (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, death from coronary heart disease, and stroke) assessed with patient-level data and trial-level data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the WHI CaD Study there was an interaction between personal use of calcium supplements and allocated calcium and vitamin D for cardiovascular events. In the 16,718 women (46%) who were not taking personal calcium supplements at randomisation the hazard ratios for cardiovascular events with calcium and vitamin D ranged from 1.13 to 1.22 (P = 0.05 for clinical myocardial infarction or stroke, P = 0.04 for clinical myocardial infarction or revascularisation), whereas in the women taking personal calcium supplements cardiovascular risk did not alter with allocation to calcium and vitamin D. In meta-analyses of three placebo controlled trials, calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.44), P = 0.04), stroke (1.20 (1.00 to 1.43), P = 0.05), and the composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.16 (1.02 to 1.32), P = 0.02). In meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials of calcium or calcium and vitamin D, complete trial-level data were available for 28,072 participants from eight trials of calcium supplements and the WHI CaD participants not taking personal calcium supplements. In total 1384 individuals had an incident myocardial infarction or stroke. Calcium or calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.24 (1.07 to 1.45), P = 0.004) and the composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.15 (1.03 to 1.27), P = 0.009).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplements with or without vitamin D modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular events, especially myocardial infarction, a finding obscured in the WHI CaD Study by the widespread use of personal calcium supplements.

Forty-nine sedentary men [age: 73 ± 6 years (mean ± SD); body mass index: 28.5 ± 3.6 kg/m2] were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n = 25; 1500 mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30 g whey protein, 2.5 g creatine, 500 IU vitamin D, and 400 mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n = 24; 22 g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20 weeks consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-week resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON + EX). At baseline, 6 weeks, and 19 weeks we assessed cognitive function [Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)], memory [word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)], executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6 weeks: 23.5 ± 3.3 vs. 19 weeks: 24.4 ± 2.5, p = 0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT increased (6 weeks: 6.6 ± 3.6 vs. 19 weeks: 7.6 ± 3.8, p = 0.047); and reaction time improved (6 weeks: 567 ± 49 ms vs. 19 weeks: 551 ± 51 ms, p = 0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58 ± 0.62, p = 0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31 ± 0.61, p = 0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r = 0.49, p = 0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r = -0.44, p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability.

Education was used as proxy for CR and visually rated medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on CT was used as parameter of neurodegeneration. Relations between CR, cognition, and MTA were analyzed with multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and cerebral atrophy. In addition, we examined if education affects the relation between MTA and cognition using an interaction variable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEducation was significantly related to all measures of cognition including subtests with an explained variance of education as a determinant of cognition of 11%. More highly educated patients had more advanced levels of MTA at the same level of cognition. All these results were stronger or only present in demented compared to non-demented patients but appeared no longer significant in those with lowest overall cognition. The interaction effect was significant indicating that with more advanced MTA, less cognitive decline was shown in higher educated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEducation is a very strong determinant of cognition in an elderly memory clinic population. The positive effect of education was stronger in demented than in non-demented patients but disappeared in those with the lowest cognitive scores indicating a \"window of CR benefit\"."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether there are differences in age and sex distribution and presence of comorbidities between participants included in randomized controlled trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and nationwide cohort of persons with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original articles from their inception to January 4, 2015. Double-blind randomized controlled trials with donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine compared to placebo in participants with Alzheimer's disease were included. Data from a nationwide cohort of persons with clinically verified diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease was defined as a reference population.\n\n\nRESULTS\n128 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, 31 of them fulfilled criteria. Mean age of participants in randomized controlled trials (n = 15,032) was 5.8 years lower (95% CI 5.7 to 5.9, P < 0.001), compared to the mean age of 79.7 years in the reference population with Alzheimer's disease (n = 28,093). Most of the articles did not report age distribution of participants. The proportion of women was 63.2% (9,475/14,991) in randomized controlled trials and 67.8% (19,043/28,093) (P < 0.001) in the reference population. Information on comorbidities and use of concomitant drugs were lacking or poorly reported in most articles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a discrepancy between participants in randomized controlled trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and real-life population with Alzheimer's disease. Participants in randomized controlled trials were significantly younger. Further, more detailed reporting of age distribution, comorbidities and concomitant drugs would be important information for clinicians when evaluating conclusions from randomized controlled trials to real-life practice. The existing recommendations of inclusion of older people should be followed to ensure safe pharmacotherapy for older people."}

BACKGROUND\nThe Mediterranean diet has long been reported to be protective against the occurrence of several different health outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to update our previous meta-analysis of published cohort prospective studies that investigated the effects of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on health status.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search through electronic databases up to June 2010.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe updated review process showed 7 prospective studies published in the past 2 y that were not included in the previous meta-analysis (1 study for overall mortality, 3 studies for cardiovascular incidence or mortality, 1 study for cancer incidence or mortality, and 2 studies for neurodegenerative diseases). These recent studies included 2 health outcomes not previously investigated (ie, mild cognitive impairment and stroke). The meta-analysis for all studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94). The meta-regression analysis showed that sample size was the most significant contributor to the model because it significantly influenced the estimate of the association for overall mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis updated meta-analysis confirms, in a larger number of subjects and studies, the significant and consistent protection provided by adherence to the Mediterranean diet in relation to the occurrence of major chronic degenerative diseases."}

BACKGROUND\nThe proportion of European elderly is expected to increase to 30% in 2060. Combining dietary components may modulate many processes involved in ageing. So, it is likely that a healthful diet approach might have greater favourable impact on age-related decline than individual dietary components. This paper describes the design of a healthful diet intervention on inflammageing and its consequences in the elderly.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe NU-AGE study is a parallel randomized one-year trial in 1250 apparently healthy, independently living European participants aged 65-80 years. Participants are randomised into either the diet group or control group. Participants in the diet group received dietary advice aimed at meeting the nutritional requirements of the ageing population. Special attention was paid to nutrients that may be inadequate or limiting in diets of elderly, such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, and calcium. C-reactive protein is measured as primary outcome.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe NU-AGE study is the first dietary intervention investigating the effect of a healthful diet providing targeted nutritional recommendations for optimal health and quality of life in apparently healthy European elderly. Results of this intervention will provide evidence on the effect of a healthful diet on the prevention of age related decline."}

A global measure of cognition mini mental state examination (MMSE) was obtained before (T0) and after (T1) the training. Multiple linear regression analyses highlighted CR as a significant factor able to predict changes in cognitive performance after the CT.

Physical frailty was defined on the basis of slow gait speed and inability to stand from a chair with one's arms folded.\n\n\nSETTING\nGeneral community in greater Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nCommunity-living persons, age 75 and older, who met criteria for physical frailty.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nMeasures of efficiency included the number of persons screened for each participant randomized, the number of persons eligible for each participant randomized, and the refusal rate. Costs were calculated per randomized participant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred eighty-eight participants, with a mean age of 83.2 years, were enrolled over 22 months. One hundred and one participants were enrolled via the office-based strategy; 87 were enrolled via the roster-based strategy. Participants in each group had considerable quadriceps weakness and performed poorly on objective measures of gait and upper- and lower-extremity function. For each participant randomized, the number of persons screened, number of persons eligible, and cost were 15.2, 1.2, and $868, respectively, for the office-based strategy and 11.6, 1.1, and $764, respectively, for the roster-based strategy. The corresponding refusal rates for the two strategies were 14.9% and 10.1%, respectively (P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough each recruitment strategy successfully identified older persons who were physically frail, the roster-based strategy was less expensive and performed modestly better on each measure of efficiency than the office-based strategy."}

As aging and neurodegeneration share pathophysiological pathways, we investigated the effect of oral Cr supplementation on aging in 162 aged C57Bl/6J mice. Outcome variables included \"healthy\" life span, neurobehavioral phenotyping, as well as morphology, biochemistry, and expression profiling from brain. The median healthy life span of Cr-fed mice was 9% higher than in control mice, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests. In brains of Cr-treated mice, there was a trend towards a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the \"aging pigment\" lipofuscin. Expression profiling showed an upregulation of genes implicated in neuronal growth, neuroprotection, and learning. These data show that Cr improves health and longevity in mice.

Due to improved health care, diet and infrastructure in developed countries, since 1840 life expectancy has increased by approximately 2 years per decade. Accordingly, by 2050, a quarter of Europe's population will be over 65 years, representing a 10 % rise in half a century. With this rapid rise comes an increased prevalence of diseases of ageing and associated healthcare expenditure. To address the health consequences of global ageing, research in model systems (worms, flies and mice) has indicated that reducing the rate of organ growth, via reductions in protein synthetic rates, has multi-organ health benefits that collectively lead to improvements in lifespan. In contrast, human pre-clinical, clinical and large cohort prospective studies demonstrate that ageing leads to anabolic (i.e. growth) impairments in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to reductions in muscle mass and strength, factors directly associated with mortality rates in the elderly. As such, increasing muscle protein synthesis via exercise or protein-based nutrition maintains a strong, healthy muscle mass, which in turn leads to improved health, independence and functionality. The aim of this review is to critique current literature relating to the maintenance of muscle mass across lifespan and discuss whether maintaining or reducing protein synthesis is the most logical approach to support musculoskeletal function and by extension healthy human ageing."}

Twenty eligible community-residing Alzheimer disease (AD) subject-caregiver dyads were randomized to the CI-PCM program (n = 10) or to usual community care (n = 10). Primary outcomes were the New York University Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (NYU-CIBIC-Plus), assessed by one clinician set, and an activities of daily living inventory, assessed by a separate clinician set at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 28.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrimary outcomes showed significant benefits of the CI-PCM program at all post-baseline evaluations.

BACKGROUND\nTo test a life course model linking circumstances of origin to self-reported literacy and numeracy problems in midlife, and to investigate the effects in this model of changing social circumstances in two post-war cohorts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBased on data from men and women in the British 1946 and 1958 birth cohorts, we used the relative index of inequality and logistical regression to test associations between father's occupation, childhood cognition, educational attainment, own occupation in the third decade, and a binary variable representing self-reported literacy and numeracy problems in the fourth decade.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a lower frequency of literacy and numeracy problems in the 1958 cohort than in the 1946 cohort. In both cohorts there were associations between father's occupation and childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation, a pattern that was mirrored by the associations between childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation to adult literacy and numeracy problems. Positive associations between childhood cognition and educational attainment, and between educational attainment and own occupation, were stronger in the 1946 cohort than in the 1958 cohort. However, inverse associations between educational attainment and literacy and numeracy problems were stronger in the 1958 cohort, possibly reflecting the expansion of secondary education in the intervening years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiteracy and numeracy problems have a robust structure of life course associations, although the changing pattern of these associations may reflect important social structural changes from the early post-war years to the early 1960s in the UK."}

To date, discussions have focused almost exclusively on addressing the practical challenges involved in estimating confidence intervals for CE ratios. However, the general approach of using confidence intervals to convey information about uncertainty around CE ratio estimates suffers from theoretical limitations that render it inappropriate in many situations. The authors present an alternative framework for analyzing uncertainty in the economic evaluation of health interventions (the \"net health benefits\" approach) that is more broadly applicable and that avoids some problems of prior methods. This approach offers several practical and theoretical advantages over the analysis of CE ratios, is straightforward to apply, and highlights some important principles in the theoretical underpinnings of CE analysis."}

All studies that evaluated the effect of cueing on gait in PD were selected by consensus of 2 pairs of authors who reviewed the titles and abstracts. Each pair of authors then applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to each study, and 25 articles were chosen. Inclusion criteria were cueing studies that reported pre- and postoutcome measures of gait parameters. Exclusion criteria were lack of data and studies that evaluated gait aids.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nGait measures of cadence, stride length, and velocity, before and after cueing, were collected from each study. If data were represented in graphs, a pair of authors extracted the data points individually, then compared and averaged values.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nThe data were synthesized using a meta-analysis based on cue type. Auditory cueing demonstrated significant improvement of cadence (Hedge g=.556; 95% confidence interval [CI], .291-.893), stride length (Hedge g=.497; 95% CI, .289-.696), and velocity (Hedge g=.544; 95% CI, .294-.795). In contrast, visual cueing significantly improved stride length only (Hedge g=.554; 95% CI, .072-1.036).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that auditory cueing is more effective for treating gait disorders in PD. Further research is needed to determine the optimum auditory cueing strategy for gait improvements."}

BACKGROUND\nImproving cardiovascular health possibly decreases the risk of dementia. Primary care practices offer a suitable setting for monitoring and controlling cardiovascular risk factors in the older population. The purpose of the study is to examine the association of a cardiovascular health metric including six behaviors and blood parameters with the risk of dementia in primary care patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants (N = 3547) were insurants aged ≥55 of the largest German statutory health insurance company, who were enrolled in a six-year prospective population-based study. Smoking, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose were assessed by general practitioners at routine examinations. Using recommended cut-offs for each factor, the patients' cardiovascular health was classified as ideal, moderate, or poor. Behaviors and blood parameters sub-scores, as well as a total score, were calculated. Dementia diagnoses were retrieved from health insurance claims data. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the course of the study 296 new cases of dementia occurred. Adjusted for age, sex, and education, current smoking (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.09-2.85), moderate (1.38, 1.05-1.81) or poor (1.81, 1.32-2.47) levels of physical activity, and poor fasting glucose levels (1.43, 1.02-2.02) were associated with an increased risk of dementia. Body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol were not associated with dementia. Separate summary scores for behaviors and blood values, as well as a total score showed no association with dementia. Sensitivity analyses with differently defined endpoints led to similar results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDue to complex relationships of body-mass index and blood pressure with dementia individual components cancelled each other out and rendered the sum-scores meaningless for the prediction of dementia."}

Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks were less likely to use AChEI and memantine with odds ratios (OR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76) and 0.43 (95% CI 0.32-0.57), respectively. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Black Hispanics were less likely to use memantine (OR=0.69 (95% CI 0.49-0.98)). No association was found between the proportion of Blacks or non-Black Hispanics versus non-Hispanic Whites at an Alzheimer Disease Center and individual use of AChEI or memantine. Other significant variables include gender, age, marital status, dementia severity, source of referral, AChEI use, and education. Education and age somewhat mitigated disparity. Significant racial and ethnic differences in AChEI and memantine use exist at the individual level regardless of the racial and ethnic composition of the individual's community. Research and initiatives at the societal level may be an important consideration toward addressing these differences."}

After nearly a century of rigorous investigation and testing, dietary caloric restriction (CR) remains the most robust and reproducible method for slowing aging and maintaining health, function, and vitality. This intervention has been applied to species across the evolutionary spectrum, but for a number of reasons, practical applicability to humans has been questioned. To overcome these issues, we initiated the field of CR mimetics in 1998 and have observed its development into a full-fledged antiaging industry. Basically, strategies that enable individuals to obtain the biological benefits of CR without reducing actual food intake can be considered CR mimetics, whether functional, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, or other. Some of the best known candidates include resveratrol and related agents, the antidiabetic drug metformin, and rapamycin and other mTOR regulators. While the mechanisms of action vary, these and essentially all CR mimetic candidates work through at least some of the same pathways as actual CR. While the entire field continues to evolve rapidly, the current status will be reviewed here, with particular focus on recent developments, the most practical relevance and applicability for potential consumers, and new strategies for the future."}

We describe a novel process for transforming the efficiency of partial expected value of sample information (EVSI) computation in decision models. Traditional EVSI computation begins with Monte Carlo sampling to produce new simulated data-sets with a specified sample size. Each data-set is synthesised with prior information to give posterior distributions for model parameters, either via analytic formulae or a further Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A further 'inner level' Monte Carlo sampling then quantifies the effect of the simulated data on the decision. This paper describes a novel form of Bayesian Laplace approximation, which can be replace both the Bayesian updating and the inner Monte Carlo sampling to compute the posterior expectation of a function. We compare the accuracy of EVSI estimates in two case study cost-effectiveness models using 1st and 2nd order versions of our approximation formula, the approximation of Tierney and Kadane, and traditional Monte Carlo. Computational efficiency gains depend on the complexity of the net benefit functions, the number of inner level Monte Carlo samples used, and the requirement or otherwise for MCMC methods to produce the posterior distributions. This methodology provides a new and valuable approach for EVSI computation in health economic decision models and potential wider benefits in many fields requiring Bayesian approximation."}

We aimed to quantify the inclusion of various ethnicities in dementia treatment RCTs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRCTs published between January 1, 2000 and August 1, 2017 (inclusive) were included. Participants were community-dwelling adults with a diagnosis of either dementia or MCI randomized to receive either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive function.

Studies showed that visual aids (icon arrays and bar graphs) improved patients' understanding and satisfaction. Presentations including absolute risk reductions were better than those including relative risk reductions for maximizing accuracy and seemed less likely than presentations with relative risk reductions to influence decisions to accept therapy. The presentation of numbers needed to treat reduced understanding.

BACKGROUND\nStudies examining whether genetic risk information about common, complex diseases can motivate individuals to improve health behaviors and advance planning have shown mixed results. Examining the influence of different study recruitment strategies may help reconcile inconsistencies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSecondary analyses were conducted on data from the REVEAL study, a series of randomized clinical trials examining the impact of genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested whether self-referred participants (SRPs) were more likely than actively recruited participants (ARPs) to report health behavior and advance planning changes after AD risk and APOE genotype disclosure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 795 participants with known recruitment status, 546 (69%) were self-referred and 249 (31%) had been actively recruited. SRPs were younger, less likely to identify as African American, had higher household incomes, and were more attentive to AD than ARPs (all P < 0.01). They also dropped out of the study before genetic risk disclosure less frequently (26% versus 41%, P < 0.001). Cohorts did not differ in their likelihood of reporting a change to at least one health behavior 6 weeks and 12 months after genetic risk disclosure, nor in intentions to change at least one behavior in the future. However, interaction effects were observed where ε4-positive SRPs were more likely than ε4-negative SRPs to report changes specifically to mental activities (38% vs 19%, p < 0.001) and diets (21% vs 12%, p = 0.016) six weeks post-disclosure, whereas differences between ε4-positive and ε4-negative ARPs were not evident for mental activities (15% vs 21%, p = 0.413) or diets (8% versus 16%, P = 0.190). Similarly, ε4-positive participants were more likely than ε4-negative participants to report intentions to change long-term care insurance among SRPs (20% vs 5%, p < 0.001), but not ARPs (5% versus 9%, P = 0.365).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIndividuals who proactively seek AD genetic risk assessment are more likely to undergo testing and use results to inform behavior changes than those who respond to genetic testing offers. These results demonstrate how the behavioral impact of genetic risk information may vary according to the models by which services are provided, and suggest that how participants are recruited into translational genomics research can influence findings.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00089882 and NCT00462917."}

AIM\nWe studied the use of patient/disease registries to recruit potential subjects for prospective clinical trials - describing the number, types and major benefits of using this approach.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn December 2013, we conducted a focused database search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for studies (English language only) that used registries to recruit subjects for clinical trials published in 2004-2013. Of the 233 unique citations identified, 21 used registries to recruit subjects - 10 papers and 11 abstracts. Pearling and search for subsequent full papers of the abstracts identified 4 more papers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur analysis, based on these 25 citations, showed that 14 are related to cancer, 3 to diabetes mellitus, 1 each to stroke, asthma, and celiac disease and 5 are disease neutral. Many types of registries (population-based cancer, quality improvement, disease-specific, web-based disease-neutral registries, local general practice registers, and national health database) are used to recruit subjects for clinical trials and uncover new knowledge. Overall, 16 registries are in the US, 4 in UK, 1 each in Canada, Spain, and Australia and 1 involved in many countries. Registries can identify very large number of subjects for screening for eligibility for clinical trials, especially in very large trials, rare disease trials, and trials involving minority patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegistries can retrospectively identify very large numbers of potential subjects for screening for eligibility and enrollment in prospective clinical trials. This matching can lead to more timely recruitment and help solve a major problem in conducting clinical trials."}

BACKGROUND\nAge is the cardinal risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are more prevalent with increasing age, may contribute to AD. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been shown to be associated with cognitive health and decreased burden of AD-related brain alterations in older adults. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine whether CRF attenuates age-related accumulation of WMH in middle-aged adults at risk for AD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and seven cognitively unimpaired, late-middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and performed graded maximal treadmill exercise testing from which we calculated the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) as our measure of CRF. Total WMH were quantified using the Lesion Segmentation Tool and scaled to intracranial volume. Linear regression adjusted for APOE4 carriage, family history, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and sex was used to examine relationships between age, WMH, and CRF.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs expected, there was a significant association between age and WMH (p < .001). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between age and OUES on WMH (p = .015). Simple main effects analyses revealed that the effect of age on WMH remained significant in the Low OUES group (p < .001) but not in the High OUES group (p = .540), indicating that higher CRF attenuates the deleterious age association with WMH.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher CRF tempers the adverse effect of age on WMH. This suggests a potential pathway through which increased aerobic fitness facilitates healthy brain aging, especially among individuals at risk for AD."}

PURPOSE\nThis article reviews the problems associated with recruiting older minorities into mental health research studies and proposes a consumer-centered model of research methodology that addresses the barriers to recruitment and retention in this population.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nThe authors discuss and compare the results of recruitment and retention interventions for two geriatric mental health studies, one that used traditional methods of recruitment and retention and another that used consumer-centered methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the consumer-centered methods result in better recruitment of older minorities in general (chi(2) = 54.90, p <.001), it was not superior to the traditional method in recruiting older minorities (chi(2) = 0.82, ns). However, the consumer-centered approach yielded better retention of older minorities (chi(2) = 6.20, p <.05) than did the traditional method. Within both methods, recruitment through provider referral and face-to-face contact were the superior recruitment methods (chi(2) = 6.78, p <.05). Having an experienced recruiter or a community recruiter resulted in greater agreement to participate than simply having an ethnically matched recruiter (chi(2) = 36.00, p <.001).\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nAlthough these data are observational, and rigorous research on the best methods for recruiting and retaining older minorities is still necessary, the results suggest that a consumer-centered model of research yields greater overall recruitment and retention rates than do traditional research methods."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the associations between classes of antihypertensive medication use and the risk of cognitive impairment among elderly hypertensive men.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Honolulu-Asia Aging Study is a prospective, community-based cohort study of Japanese American men conducted in Honolulu, Hawaii. We examined 2,197 participants (mean age 77 years at cohort entry, 1991-1993, followed through September 2010) with hypertension and without dementia or cognitive impairment at baseline, who provided information on medication use. Cognitive function was assessed at 7 standardized examinations using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). Cognitive impairment was defined as a CASI score <74.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 854 men developed cognitive impairment (median follow-up, 5.8 years). β-Blocker use as the sole antihypertensive drug at baseline was consistently associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94), as compared with men not taking any antihypertensive medications, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. The use of diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilators alone was not significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Results were similar excluding those with cardiovascular disease or <1 year of follow-up, and additionally adjusting for pulse pressure, heart rate, baseline and midlife systolic blood pressure, and midlife antihypertensive treatment (IRR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.94). The association between β-blocker use and cognitive impairment was stronger among men with diabetes, men aged >75 years, and those with pulse pressure ≥70 mm Hg.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nβ-blocker use is associated with a lower risk of developing cognitive impairment in elderly Japanese American men."}

Body weight and serum glucose concentration were regularly recorded, and animals were sacrificed and hippocampus tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry (n=6 per group), western blotting (n=3 per group) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (n=3 per group) analysis at the end of the 44-week experimental period. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect changes in hippocampal proteins may be involved in the SIRT1/mTOR pathways.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBody weight and serum glucose over the 44 weeks in animals from the CR group were lower than those of HE group. The number of SIRT1-immunoreactive cells in the CR group was significantly higher than in the NC and HE groups, and SIRT1 mRNA expression in the CR group was significantly higher than that in the HE group, but there was no difference in SIRT1 protein expression among the three groups. mTOR and S6K1 protein activation and mTOR and S6K1 mRNA were significantly lower in the CR group than in the NC group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that a CR diet could lead to activation of SIRT1 and suppression of mTOR and S6K1 activation in C57BL/6 mice. We have shown that the SIRT1/mTOR signaling pathways may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of CR."}

A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Natural flavonoids are promising agents for inflammation-related tumor progression in patients with CRC. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of flavonoid fisetin supplementation on the inflammatory status and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in these patients. In this double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, 37 CRC patients undergoing chemotherapy were assigned to receive either 100 mg fisetin (n = 18) or placebo (n = 19) for seven consecutive weeks. The supplementation began one week before chemotherapy and continued until the end of the second chemotherapy cycle. Levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), MMP-7, and MMP-9 were measured in plasma using ELISA, before and after the intervention. The trial was registered at http://www.irct.ir (code: IRCT2015110511288N9). The participants were 55.59 ± 15.46 years old with 62.16% being male. After the intervention, the plasma levels of IL-8 and hs-CRP reduced significantly in the fisetin group (p < 0.04 and p < 0.01, respectively). Additionally, fisetin supplementation suppressed the values of MMP-7 levels (p < 0.02). However, significant changes were observed only in IL-8 concentrations in the fisetin group when compared with the placebo group (p < 0.03). The changes in the levels of other metabolic factors were not statistically significant. According to the results, fisetin could improve the inflammatory status in CRC patients, suggesting it as a novel complementary antitumor agent for these patients and warranting further studies."}

Much has been achieved by recent research to increase understanding of the links between nutrition and muscle health. Focusing on muscle strength as the key component of sarcopenia, the aim of this overview was to evaluate its links to nutrition, both to variation in habitual diets in older populations, as well as considering supplementation effects in trials. A main message from the reviewed studies is that while many provide suggestive evidence of benefits of higher nutrient intakes and diets of higher quality, findings are inconsistent, and data on muscle strength are often lacking. To assess the potential of optimising diets as a strategy to promote and maintain muscle strength, gaps in current evidence need to be addressed. These include the need for (i) better understanding of individual differences in responsiveness to dietary change, and the need for targeted nutritional support; (ii) clearer distinction between protective and therapeutic actions of diet; and (iii) definition of the role of dietary patterns and their influence on muscle strength, to allow effects of changes in food consumption to be evaluated-particularly when combined with physical activity. Development of this evidence is needed to enable translation into appropriate dietary recommendations for older populations."}

From electronic records, we calculated subjects' annual mean systolic blood pressure. We asked about the last missed antihypertensive dose in six time intervals. Based on association with blood pressure control, non-adherence was defined as missing any dose in the past 3 months. Subjects were also asked about six domains of adherence barriers: health, personal support, drug coverage, medication filling and use, doctor-patient interaction and knowledge. All models adjust for demographics, treatment regimen and sampling weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 202 subjects (67% response rate) were: female (65.9%), black (64.8%), mean age 77.4 years (5.49) and on mean 2.4 (SD 1.3) antihypertensive drugs. Mean annual systolic pressure for non-adherent subjects (22% of the cohort) was higher than adherent subjects (137.7 vs.133.4 mmHg, p = 0.065). After adjustment, the association between adherence and blood pressure was stronger in black than white patients (p = 0.007). In an initial model, being unaware of Medicare Part D had a lower adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of adherence (p < 0.05). In the final model, adherence barriers were: medication filling/use (run out of pills [AOR 0.25, CI 0.09-0.66] and 28% reduction per each of eight barriers); doctor-patient interaction (less important to discuss hypertension [AOR 0.32, CI 0.12-0.84]); and knowledge (38% lower AOR per incorrect answer about diseases unrelated to hypertension).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSelf-reported adherence was associated with a higher blood pressure, especially in elderly black patients. To promote adherence, our data suggest targeting: filling prescriptions, prioritizing hypertension care and educating about effects of hypertension."}

There is evidence from human twin and family studies as well as mouse and rat selection experiments that there are considerable interindividual differences in the response of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and other cardiometabolic traits to a given exercise programme dose. We developed this consensus statement on exercise response variability following a symposium dedicated to this topic. There is strong evidence from both animal and human studies that exercise training doses lead to variable responses. A genetic component contributes to exercise training response variability.In this consensus statement, we (1) briefly review the literature on exercise response variability and the various sources of variations in CRF response to an exercise programme, (2) introduce the key research designs and corresponding statistical models with an emphasis on randomised controlled designs with or without multiple pretests and post-tests, crossover designs and repeated measures designs, (3) discuss advantages and disadvantages of multiple methods of categorising exercise response levels-a topic that is of particular interest for personalised exercise medicine and (4) outline approaches that may identify determinants and modifiers of CRF exercise response. We also summarise gaps in knowledge and recommend future research to better understand exercise response variability."}

BACKGROUND\nDespite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few Australian childcare services provide food that is consistent with dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the intervention using data collected within the trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12 months. Costs (reported in $AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service. The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative value index was calculated to determine overall value for money.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the 12 months of the trial, we calculated a difference in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of - $482 (95% UI - $859, - $56). While the measured increase in menu and food group compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance, there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes generated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCompared to usual practice, web-based programmes may offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616000974404."}

The current study has two aims: (a) to examine some new practices in recruitment of African American elders and (b) to determine the similarities and differences of the volunteers in the Healthier Black Elders (HBE) Participant Resource Pool (PRP), with a population-based community sample from the Detroit Health Needs Assessment (Chapleski, E. E. (2002). Facing the future: City of Detroit needs assessment). Detroit, MI: Wayne State University.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nA community-based participatory research approach was used to establish the HBE as an educational and support program in Detroit and to use HBE to launch a research participant registry of older Black adults. Data were drawn from a community-based telephone survey of 723 older African American elders aged 60 years and older recruited into the PRP registry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPRP participants had some differences from those in the Detroit Health Needs Assessment. These included that older women had a significantly higher participatory rate compared with their male counterparts. African American women in the PRP reported a modestly healthier life with less disability compared with their Detroit Health Needs Assessment counterparts, whereas for men, it was the reverse for chronic diseases. The PRP was able to attract a significantly higher percentage of older old compared with the population = based survey.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nStudy findings suggest that the HBE approach of recruiting African American elders in health research appears effective and to have some unique strengths."}

PURPOSE\nCreatine supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle strength and power after only 5-7 d in young adults. Creatine supplementation could therefore benefit older individuals because aging is associated with a decrease in muscle strength and explosive power.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examined the effects of 7 d of creatine supplementation in normally active older men (59-72 yr) by using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design with repeated measures. After a 3-wk familiarization period to minimize learning effects, a battery of tests was completed on three occasions separated by 7 d (T1, T2, and T3). After T1, subjects were matched and randomly assigned into creatine (N = 10) and placebo (N = 8) groups. After T2, subjects consumed supplements (0.3 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 7 d until T3. All subjects were tested for maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum leg press and bench press), maximal isometric strength (knee extension/flexion), upper- and lower-body explosive power (6 x 10-s sprints on a cycle ergometer), and lower-extremity functional ability (timed sit-stand test and tandem gait test). Body composition was assessed via hydrostatic weighing, and blood samples were obtained to assess renal and hepatic responses and muscle creatine concentrations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant increases in any performance measures were observed from T1 to T2 with the exception of isometric right-knee flexion in the placebo group indicating stability in the testing protocols. Significant group-by -time interactions indicated the responses from T2 to T3 were significantly greater (P <or= 0.05) in the creatine compared with the placebo group, respectively, for body mass (1.86 and -1.01 kg), fat-free mass (2.22 and 0.00 kg), maximal dynamic strength (7-8 and 1-2%), maximal isometric strength (9-15 and -6 to 1%), lower-body mean power (11 and 0%), and lower-extremity functional capacity (6-9 and 1-2%). No adverse side effects were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data indicate that 7 d of creatine supplementation is effective at increasing several indices of muscle performance, including functional tests in older men without adverse side effects. Creatine supplementation may be a useful therapeutic strategy for older adults to attenuate loss in muscle strength and performance of functional living tasks."}

Leg fatigue was determined using an isokinetic dynamometer; subjects performed 5 sets of 30 maximal voluntary contractions at 180 degrees x s(-1), with 1 min of recovery between sets. The strength of the elbow flexors was assessed using a modified preacher bench attached to a strain gauge. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05; group x time) in leg fatigue following supplementation. However, this interaction appears to have resulted from a combination of the improved fatigue score by the Cr-supplemented group and the decreased fatigue score by the P-supplemented group, because when the simple main effects were analyzed for the groups individually, there was no significant difference over time for either of the groups. There were no significant differences in body mass, body density, or fat-free mass as assessed by hydrostatic weighing, or strength between the Cr-supplemented or P-supplemented groups. These data suggest that 30 days of Cr-supplementation may have a beneficial effect on reducing muscle fatigue in men over the age of 60 years, but it does not affect body composition or strength."}

OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this systematic review was to identify, evaluate, and meta-analyze cohort studies reporting the association of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) intake with mortality and cardiovascular events.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective cohort studies were conducted. Study appraisal included a thorough risk of bias assessment. Data synthesis followed a random-effects model.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nThe included studies were retrieved from the databases MEDLINE and ISI Web of Knowledge. Additionally, the authors checked the references of the included studies for further relevant literature.\n\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES\nFor inclusion in a study, the population needed to be older than 60 years of age and not restricted to having one specific disease. The outcome had to address all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. Studies that examined polypharmacy or specific drugs were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt first, 13 studies were included in a meta-analysis. The association of PIM with overall mortality was not statistically significant (risk ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.13; 0.95-1.35). However, the majority of studies showed a high risk of specific forms of bias. These biases can be excluded by applying a new user design. It ascertains that adverse events occurring early in therapy are recorded. After restricting the meta-analysis to three studies with a new user design, the association of PIM use and mortality was statistically significant (risk ratio; 95% confidence interval, 1.59; 1.45-1.75). Only one study focused on cardiovascular events and found no statistically significant association. However, the study was not conducted with a new user design.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn studies with adequate methods (new user design), PIM use, defined by Beers criteria or the HEDIS-DAE list, was associated with a 1.6-fold increased mortality in older adults. Physicians should therefore avoid prescribing PIM for older adults whenever feasible. Further new user design studies are required for cardiovascular outcomes and to compare the predictive value of different PIM criteria for mortality."}

Impairment or interruption of oxygen supply compromises brain function and plays a role in neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound involved in the buffering, transport, and regulation of cellular energy, with the potential to replenish cellular adenosine triphosphate without oxygen. Creatine is also neuroprotective in vitro against anoxic/hypoxic damage. Dietary creatine supplementation has been associated with improved symptoms in neurological disorders defined by impaired neural energy provision. Here we investigate, for the first time in humans, the utility of creatine as a dietary supplement to protect against energetic insult. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of oral creatine supplementation on the neurophysiological and neuropsychological function of healthy young adults during acute oxygen deprivation. Fifteen healthy adults were supplemented with creatine and placebo treatments for 7 d, which increased brain creatine on average by 9.2%. A hypoxic gas mixture (10% oxygen) was administered for 90 min, causing global oxygen deficit and impairing a range of neuropsychological processes. Hypoxia-induced decrements in cognitive performance, specifically attentional capacity, were restored when participants were creatine supplemented, and corticomotor excitability increased. A neuromodulatory effect of creatine via increased energy availability is presumed to be a contributing factor of the restoration, perhaps by supporting the maintenance of appropriate neuronal membrane potentials. Dietary creatine monohydrate supplementation augments neural creatine, increases corticomotor excitability, and prevents the decline in attention that occurs during severe oxygen deficit. This is the first demonstration of creatine's utility as a neuroprotective supplement when cellular energy provision is compromised."}

BACKGROUND\nAmong the large number of cohort studies that employ propensity score matching, most match patients 1:1. Increasing the matching ratio is thought to improve precision but may come with a trade-off with respect to bias.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate several methods of propensity score matching in cohort studies through simulation and empirical analyses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe simulated cohorts of 20,000 patients with exposure prevalence of 10%-50%. We simulated five dichotomous and five continuous confounders. We estimated propensity scores and matched using digit-based greedy (\"greedy\"), pairwise nearest neighbor within a caliper (\"nearest neighbor\"), and a nearest neighbor approach that sought to balance the scores of the comparison patient above and below that of the treated patient (\"balanced nearest neighbor\"). We matched at both fixed and variable matching ratios and also evaluated sequential and parallel schemes for the order of formation of 1:n match groups. We then applied this same approach to two cohorts of patients drawn from administrative claims data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 generally resulted in somewhat higher bias. It also resulted in lower variance with variable ratio matching but higher variance with fixed. The parallel approach generally resulted in higher mean squared error but lower bias than the sequential approach. Variable ratio, parallel, balanced nearest neighbor matching generally yielded the lowest bias and mean squared error.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n1:n matching can be used to increase precision in cohort studies. We recommend a variable ratio, parallel, balanced 1:n, nearest neighbor approach that increases precision over 1:1 matching at a small cost in bias."}

BACKGROUND\nEarly screenings involving biomarkers and use of potential disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may have significant humanistic implications for treatment strategies in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMarkov models simulated transitions of patient cohorts beginning in predementia, a hypothetical early stage of Alzheimer's disease marked by objective cognitive impairment/memory complaints without functional impairment, and followed for 10 years. Hypothetical cohorts of 10,000 patients included those who were treated with standard of care (donepezil) upon reaching mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease, a DMT in predementia, and a DMT in mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Transition probabilities were based on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and published clinical data, and estimated for the hypothetical DMT. In each disease stage (predementia, mild, moderate, or severe), time was computed and costs were estimated using literature review and published data, and published data provided mortality rates. The impact of screening was evaluated using positive predictive value (patients identified as predementia truly at risk for transition to dementia).\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarlier treatment yielded modest gains in total life-years; however, the distribution was skewed towards milder disease. Assuming a 25% reduction in the annual risk of progression, treating predementia patients with DMT increased life-years in predementia to mild states on average from 3.2 to 4.2, while life-years spent in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease decreased from 2.6 to 2.2. Average time in the community increased from 4.4 to 5.4 years, while time in long-term care declined from 1.3 to 0.9 years. This impact grows as the advantage of the novel agent increases. Screening accuracy had significant implications for cost-effectiveness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf screening can accurately identify predementia patients at risk for progression, earlier treatment with DMTs has the potential benefit to patients of prolonging time in milder disease, reducing time spent with more severe disease, increasing time in the community, and reducing time in long-term care."}

Compared to CD, BD resulted in a 24% increase (p<0.001) of ROS indexed t(MPT). The remaining animals were subjected to a permanent ligation of the left descending coronary artery. 24 hrs later resulting myocardial infarction (MI) in rats on BD was 22% less than in CD rats (p<0.01). Significantly less TUNEL(+) cardiomyocytes (2% vs 9%) and 40% less inflammation cells were observed in the myocardial area at risk of BD compared to CD rats (p<0.01). In the subgroup of rats, after coronary ligation the original diet was either continued or switched to the opposite one, and cardiac remodeling and MI expansion were followed by serial echocardiography for 10 weeks. Measurements suggested that continuation of BD or its withdrawal after MI attenuated or accelerated rates of post MI cardiac remodeling and MI expansion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA blueberry-enriched diet protected the myocardium from induced ischemic damage and demonstrated the potential to attenuate the development of post MI chronic heart failure."}

By assessing language skills on 345 Down's syndrome adults living in Leicestershire (91% of the total population), the present authors have been able to confirm this finding, using the AAMD Adaptive Behaviour Scale. This may have clinical relevance with regard to communication with older people with Down's syndrome, and also for estimation of an individual's skill level when he or she was younger."}

A sample of 249 states defined by the SF-6D have been valued by a representative sample of 611 members of the UK general population, using standard gamble. Models are estimated for predicting health state valuations for all 18,000 states defined by the SF-6D. The econometric modelling had to cope with the hierarchical nature of the data and its skewed distribution. The recommended models have produced significant coefficients for levels of the SF-6D, which are robust across model specification. However, there are concerns with some inconsistent estimates and over prediction of the value of the poorest health states. These problems must be weighed against the rich descriptive ability of the SF-6D, and the potential application of these models to existing and future SF-36 data set."}

OBJECTIVES\nTo provide information on the advantages and possible disadvantages of using canes and walkers.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nEnglish-language articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-May 2003) for key words cane or walker , excluding articles unrelated to mobility aids. Bibliographies were reviewed and ISI Web of Science citation searches were run to identify additional references. Over 1000 articles were selected for further evaluation.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nWe extracted all studies of single-tip canes or pickup walkers addressing: (1) functional, biomechanic, or neuromotor benefits; (2) biomechanic, attentional, neuromotor, metabolic, or physiologic demands; and (3) falls, injuries, or other problems. We included approximately 10% of the articles originally identified.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nThe methodology of each selected article, and findings relevant to the benefits, demands, or adverse effects of cane or walker use were summarized.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nFindings were synthesized by considering their relation to basic biomechanic principles. Some biomechanic findings appear to support the clinical view that canes and walkers can improve balance and mobility for older adults and people with other clinical conditions. However, a large proportion of users experience difficulties, and the use of such devices is associated with increased risk of falling. A small number of studies have characterized some of the specific demands and problems associated with using mobility aids.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinical and biomechanic evaluations of canes and walkers confirm that these devices can improve balance and mobility. However, they can also interfere with ones ability to maintain balance in certain situations, and the strength and metabolic demands can be excessive. More research is needed to identify and solve specific problems. Such research may lead to improved designs and guidelines for safer use of canes and walkers."}

Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., 'borrowing') this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of 'dynamic' (versus 'static') borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners."}

PURPOSE\nTo examine the contribution of \"values-based reasoning\" in evaluating older adults' capacity to make medical decisions.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nOlder men with schizophrenia (n=20) or dementia (n=20), and a primary care comparison group (n=19), completed cognitive and psychiatric screening and an interview to determine their capacity to make medical decisions, which included a component on values. All of the participants were receiving treatment at Veterans Administration (VA) outpatient clinics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants varied widely in the activities and relationships they most valued, the extent to which religious beliefs would influence healthcare decisions, and in ratings of the importance of preserving quality versus length of life. Most participants preferred shared decision making with doctor, family, or both. Individuals with schizophrenia or dementia performed worse than a primary care comparison group in reasoning measured by the ability to list risks and benefits and compare choices. Individuals with dementia performed comparably to the primary care group in reasoning measured by the ability to justify choices in terms of valued abilities or activities, whereas individuals with schizophrenia performed relatively worse compared to the other two groups. Compared to primary care patients, participants with schizophrenia and with dementia were impaired on the ability to explain treatment choices in terms of valued relationships.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMedical decision making may be influenced by strongly held values and beliefs, emotions, and long life experience. To date, these issues have not been explicitly included in structured evaluations of medical decision-making capacity. This study demonstrated that it is possible to inquire of and elicit a range of healthcare related values and preferences from older adults with dementia or schizophrenia, and individuals with mild to moderate dementia may be able to discuss healthcare options in relation to their values.

Most cost-effectiveness studies using simulation modeling have demonstrated that donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are cost effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). These conclusions are in large part based on the assumption that improvement in cognitive status, or prevention of cognitive and functional decline, reduces the amount of time patients spend institutionalized or receiving other full-time care. However, as discussed in this article, outcomes besides delay to institutionalization affect the costs of AD. In reviews of utilization data from Medicare and managed care organizations, it was noted that hospitalization and post acute care in skilled nursing facilities accounted for the largest amount of excess direct costs, even among patients with mild or moderate AD. These utilization reviews also suggest that many patients with AD and related dementias require inpatient care because they are not able to self-manage comorbid conditions. The improvements in cognitive status and daily functioning associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy are expected to translate into improved management of comorbidities and reduced caregiver burden, thus reducing the total cost of care. To confirm these and other economic benefits of AChEIs, pharmacoeconomic outcomes should be evaluated routinely as part of randomized, controlled trials and through well-controlled observational studies of AD patients in community and institutional settings."}

The posthospital acceleration in cognitive decline was also evident on measures of episodic memory (3.3-fold increase) and executive function (1.7-fold increase). The rate of cognitive decline after hospitalization was not related to the level of cognitive function at study entry (r = 0.01, p = 0.88) but was moderately correlated with rate of cognitive decline before hospitalization (r = 0.55, p = 0.021). More severe illness, longer hospital stay, and older age were each associated with faster cognitive decline after hospitalization but did not eliminate the effect of hospitalization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn old age, cognitive functioning tends to decline substantially after hospitalization even after controlling for illness severity and prehospital cognitive decline."}

OBJECTIVES\nTo test the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) influence predisposition to and the clinical course of Alzheimer disease (AD), the authors compared Choctaw Indians, a group with known high CRF with white persons with AD. In addition to CRF history, the authors investigated the frequency of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype andplasma homocysteine (HC) levels.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors compared 39 Choctaw Indians with AD and 39 Choctaw Indians without AD to 39 white persons with AD with all groups similar in age. CRF history included diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or hypolipidemic agent use, or myocardial infarction. The authors also compared plasma HC concentration and apoE4 allele frequency.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChoctaw persons with AD differed significantly from white persons with AD in history of hypertension, diabetes, and in HC values but not from Indians without AD. There was a significantly lower apoE4 allele frequency in Choctaw Indian AD than white persons with AD, and both AD groups had an affected first degree relative significantly more often than Indian controls. There was no relationship between the number of CRF and age at onset among Indians or whites, whereas HC concentration was associated with significantly earlier age of onset for Choctaw Indians but not for whites.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis small study suggests that in Choctaw Indians modifiable risk factors may play more of a role in disease pathogenesis than in whites and that nonmodifiable risk factors such as apoE4 may play less of a role."}

Importance\nRecent studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether testosterone treatment increases cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nObjective\nTo test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone slows progression of noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nDouble-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at 9 academic medical centers in the United States. The participants were 170 of 788 men aged 65 years or older with an average of 2 serum testosterone levels lower than 275 ng/dL (82 men assigned to placebo, 88 to testosterone) and symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism who were enrolled in the Testosterone Trials between June 24, 2010, and June 9, 2014.\n\n\nIntervention\nTestosterone gel, with the dose adjusted to maintain the testosterone level in the normal range for young men, or placebo gel for 12 months.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume, as determined by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Secondary outcomes included total coronary artery plaque volume and coronary artery calcium score (range of 0 to >400 Agatston units, with higher values indicating more severe atherosclerosis).\n\n\nResults\nOf 170 men who were enrolled, 138 (73 receiving testosterone treatment and 65 receiving placebo) completed the study and were available for the primary analysis. Among the 138 men, the mean (SD) age was 71.2 (5.7) years, and 81% were white. At baseline, 70 men (50.7%) had a coronary artery calcification score higher than 300 Agatston units, reflecting severe atherosclerosis. For the primary outcome, testosterone treatment compared with placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in noncalcified plaque volume from baseline to 12 months (from median values of 204 mm3 to 232 mm3 vs 317 mm3 to 325 mm3, respectively; estimated difference, 41 mm3; 95% CI, 14 to 67 mm3; P = .003). For the secondary outcomes, the median total plaque volume increased from baseline to 12 months from 272 mm3 to 318 mm3 in the testosterone group vs from 499 mm3 to 541 mm3 in the placebo group (estimated difference, 47 mm3; 95% CI, 13 to 80 mm3; P = .006), and the median coronary artery calcification score changed from 255 to 244 Agatston units in the testosterone group vs 494 to 503 Agatston units in the placebo group (estimated difference, -27 Agatston units; 95% CI, -80 to 26 Agatston units). No major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in either group.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAmong older men with symptomatic hypogonadism, treatment with testosterone gel for 1 year compared with placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume, as measured by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Larger studies are needed to understand the clinical implications of this finding.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00799617."}

Over the past 50 years, the percentage of the elderly population has increased fourfold from 5.7% in 1960 to 23.1% in 2010. This change has occurred at the fastest rate in the world. Compared with France, where the percentage of the elderly population has increased just twofold in the past 100 years, Japanese society is aging at an unprecedented rate. In addition, the percentage of the very elderly (aged 75 years and over), comprising more frail people, exceeded 10% of the nation's population in 2008. In such a situation, many elderly Japanese wish to spend their later years healthy, and wish to achieve great accomplishments in their lives. To achieve that, rather than considering an aging population as a negative social phenomenon, we should create a society where elderly people can enjoy a healthy, prosperous life through social participation and contribution. Factors that hamper the elderly from leading a healthy life include various psychological and social problems occurring in older age, as well as a high incidence of diseases. Therefore, gerontology, which focuses on health promotion of the elderly by encompassing the study of social welfare, psychology, environment and social systems; and geriatrics, which focuses on health care of elderly people and carried out research, education and practices to promote health in the elderly, are becoming more important. Furthermore, along with a need for multidisciplinary care to support geriatric medicine, the development of a comprehensive education system for aged-care professionals is awaited. Thus, we should now recognize the importance of gerontology and geriatrics, and a reform of medical-care services should be made in order to cope with the coming aged society. Population aging is a global phenomenon. The actions being taken by Japan, the world's most aged society, have been closely watched by the rest of the world. Japan's aged society has been posing not only medical, nursing and welfare problems, but also complex problems closely associated with economy, industry and culture. Therefore, to solve these problems, a macroscopic integration and cooperation among industries, education institutions, administration and community through an interdisciplinary approach including medical science, nursing science, nursing care, study of social welfare, social science, engineering, psychology, economics, religion and ethics should be made. Regarding the promotion of gerontology, the \"Committee for Establishing a Scientific Community for Sustainable Aged Society\" of the Science Council of Japan also prepared a proposal and this was announced on 20 April 2011. 2.\n\n\nCURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS\n(1) Promotion of social participation and contribution of elderly people In Japan, the overall labor force rate is expected to decrease in the near future as a result of the low birth rate and high life expectancy. In contrast, many elderly people, particularly the young-old, have sufficient physical strength to fulfil their job duties and make a social contribution. For these people, a social structure where elderly people can work should be developed through re-educating the elderly and providing various job types. Promotion of social participation and contribution of the elderly is expected to cause a substantial increase in the labor force. Furthermore, it is also expected to contribute to not only the upturn of national economic activity through an increase in total consumption, but also a decrease in the number of elderly people who are likely to be in need of care. Therefore, in order for elderly people to be engaged in various social activities, strategies for developing a social structure for re-education, various employment statuses and employment opportunities should be prepared. However, as the total number of jobs is fixed, consideration should also be given to young workers. (2) Fostering medical specialists for aging Older people often suffer from many diseases, together with geriatric syndromes with multiple etiologies. Signs and symptoms vary according to each individual, and are often atypical; therefore, the patients visit different hospitals and receive many screening tests and prescriptions at the same time. To solve this problem, an effective screening system carried out by a primary-care doctor, and privacy-preserving medical data sharing among hospitals and clinics are needed. In a geriatric clinical setting, health-care professionals should be aware of the physical traits of older people who often develop not only dementia, but also geriatric syndromes, such as depression, falls and urinary incontinence, so that a holistic approach with consideration of nursing care is required. However, the existing Japanese medical education system is not prepared for medical professionals enabled to respond to the aforementioned requirements. Thus, the fostering of medical professionals who can provide comprehensive care - especially for the oldest-old - such as geriatric specialists and medical professionals who understand the principles of elderly care, is urgently needed. (3) Diagnosis of elderly-specific diseases and reform of medical-care services In Japan, the diagnostic system for elderly-specific diseases, including dementia, and reform of medical care services are markedly delayed. The current status concerning diagnosis, care and nursing should be investigated to collect academic data. In order to accumulate evidence for providing safe elderly care and nursing, the promotion of clinical research and a marked expansion of geriatric medical centers with high-level medical services are eagerly awaited. (4) Promotion of home-based care and multidisciplinary care To reduce the length of stay in acute hospitals, to reduce the physical burden of health-care professionals working at acute hospitals and to meet the demand of older people who prefer to remain in their own homes, further promotion of home-based care is needed. In addition, \"multidisciplinary care\" is increasingly needed to meet various demands in the medical care and welfare of the elderly. It is considered important to share countermeasures against the problems of disease prevention, medicine, care and welfare among health-care professionals in medicine, care and welfare, and cooperate by making the best use of health-care professionals' specialties. 3.\n\n\nCONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe subcommittee for aging, thus, provided the following proposal: 1 Development and promotion of systems that enable elderly people to participate socially and make a contribution using an interdisciplinary approach among the various areas, including nursing science, nursing care, study of social welfare, social science, psychology, economics, religion and ethics, as well as medical sciences; 2 Promotion of gerontology, reform and enhancement of geriatrics in undergraduate, postgraduate and lifelong education; 3 Building geriatric medical centers in each area, and accumulating large-scale evidence of geriatric diseases and geriatrics; and 4 Structural development and promotion of home-based care and multidisciplinary care. Through implementation of the above measures, Japan is expected to function as a successful example for the rest of the world."}

PURPOSE\nTo estimate Swedish experience-based value sets for EQ-5D health states using general population health survey data.\n\n\nMETHODS\nApproximately 45,000 individuals valued their current health status by means of time trade off (TTO) and visual analogue scale (VAS) methods and answered the EQ-5D questionnaire, making it possible to model the association between the experience-based TTO and VAS values and the EQ-5D dimensions and severity levels. The association between TTO and VAS values and the different severity levels of respondents' answers on a self-rated health (SRH) question was assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlmost all dimensions (except usual activity) and severity levels had less impact on TTO valuations compared with the UK study based on hypothetical values. Anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values. TTO and VAS values were consistently related to SRH. The inclusion of age, sex, education and socioeconomic group affected the main effect coefficients and the explanatory power modestly.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA value set for EQ-5D health states based on Swedish valuations has been lacking. Several authors have recently advocated the normative standpoint of using experience-based values. Guidelines of economic evaluation for reimbursement decisions in Sweden recommend the use of experience-based values for QALY calculations. Our results that anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values underline the importance of mental health for individuals' overall HRQoL. Using population surveys is in line with recent thinking on valuing health states and could reduce some of the focusing effects potentially appearing in hypothetical valuation studies."}

UNLABELLED\nCreatine supplementation improves glucose tolerance in healthy subjects.\n\n\nPURPOSES\nThe aim was to investigate whether creatine supplementation has a beneficial effect on glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients undergoing exercise training.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 12-wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed. The patients were allocated to receive either creatine (CR) (5 g·d) or placebo (PL) and were enrolled in an exercise training program. The primary outcome was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included the area under the curve of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide and insulin sensitivity indexes. Physical capacity, lipid profile, and GLUT-4 protein expression and translocation were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-five subjects were analyzed (CR: n=13; PL: n=12). HbA1c was significantly reduced in the creatine group when compared with the placebo group (CR: PRE=7.4 ± 0.7, POST=6.4 ± 0.4; PL: PRE=7.5 ± 0.6, POST=7.6 ± 0.7; P=0.004; difference=-1.1%, 95% confidence interval=-1.9% to -0.4%). The delta area under the curve of glucose concentration was significantly lower in the CR group than in the PL group (CR=-7790 ± 4600, PL=2008 ± 7614; P=0.05). The CR group also presented decreased glycemia at times 0, 30, and 60 min during a meal tolerance test and increased GLUT-4 translocation. Insulin and C-peptide concentrations, surrogates of insulin sensitivity, physical capacity, lipid profile, and adverse effects were comparable between the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCreatine supplementation combined with an exercise program improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. The underlying mechanism seems to be related to an increase in GLUT-4 recruitment to the sarcolemma."}

Although 39% of phase I subjects responding to initial contact attempts participated in the second phase of the study, this dropped to 12% among those responding to the sixth contact attempt (a phone follow-up). In studies in which the representatives of the sample is not of paramount importance, we see little benefit in aggressively seeking to recruit hard-to-reach subjects."}

BACKGROUND\nBeliefs concerning the causes of mental illness may help to explain why there are significant disparities in the rates of formal mental health service use among racial/ethnic minority elderly as compared with their white counterparts. This study applies the cultural influences on mental health framework to identify the relationship between race/ethnicity and differences in 1) beliefs on the cause of mental illness, 2) preferences for type of treatment, and 3) provider characteristics.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAnalyses were conducted using baseline data collected from participants who completed the cultural attitudes toward healthcare and mental illness questionnaire, developed for the Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly study, a multisite randomized trial for older adults (65+) with depression, anxiety, or at-risk alcohol consumption. The final sample consisted of 1,257 non-Latino whites, 536 African Americans, 112 Asian Americans, and 303 Latinos.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfrican Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos had differing beliefs regarding the causes of mental illness when compared with non-Latino whites.

INTRODUCTION\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths and illnesses in US adults, and the prevalence is disproportionately high in underserved populations. In this study, we assessed respondents' understanding of context-specific differences in knowledge and perceptions of disease, risk, and prevention in 6 underserved communities, with the longer-term goal of developing appropriate interventions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-nine small-group sessions and 14 interviews yielded data from 318 adults. Each site's researchers coded, analyzed, and extracted key themes from local data. Investigators from all sites synthesized results and identified common themes and differences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThemes clustered in 3 areas (barriers to cardiovascular health, constraints related to multiple roles, and suggestions for effective communications and programs). Barriers spanned individual, social and cultural, and environmental levels; women in particular cited multiple roles (eg, competing demands, lack of self-care). Programmatic suggestions included the following: personal, interactive, social context; information in language that people use; activities built around cultural values and interests; and community orientation. In addition, respondents preferred health-related information from trusted groups (eg, AARP), health care providers (but with noticeable differences of opinion), family and friends, and printed materials.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInterventions to decrease barriers to cardiovascular health are needed; these strategies should include family and community context, small groups, interactive methods, culturally sensitive materials, and trusted information sources. New-immigrant communities need culturally and linguistically tailored education before receiving more substantive interventions."}

BACKGROUND\nClinical practice guidelines that help clinicians and patients to understand the magnitude of expected individual risks and benefits would help with patient-centered decision-making and prioritization of care. We assessed the net benefit from taking daily aspirin to estimate the individual and public health implications of a more individualized decision-making approach.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey representing all US persons aged 30 to 85 years with no history of myocardial infarction and applied a Markov model based on randomized evidence and published literature to estimate lifetime effects of aspirin treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We found that treatment benefit varies greatly by an individual's cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Almost all adults have fewer major clinical events on aspirin, but for most, events prevented would be so rare that even a very small distaste for aspirin use would make treatment inappropriate. With minimal dislike of aspirin use (disutility, 0.005 QALY per year), only those with a 10-year cardiac event risk >6.1% would have a net benefit. A disutility of 0.01 QALY moves this benefit cut point to 10.6%. Multiple factors altered the absolute benefit of aspirin, but the strong relationship between CVD risk and magnitude of benefit was robust.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe benefits of aspirin therapy depend substantially on an individual's risk of CVD and adverse treatment effects. Understanding who benefits from aspirin use and how much can help clinicians and patients to develop a more patient-centered approach to preventive therapy."}

Using national vital statistics mortality data, we estimated Hispanic age-specific and age-adjusted death rates, which were uncorrected and corrected for death certificate misclassification, and produced death rate ratios comparing the Hispanic with the non-Hispanic White population.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States is reasonably good. The net ascertainment of Hispanic origin is just 5% higher on survey records than on death certificates.

The adjusted odds ratio for any anticholinergic drug with an ACB score of 3 was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.14). Dementia was associated with an increasing average ACB score. When considered by drug class, gastrointestinal drugs with an ACB score of 3 were not distinctively linked to dementia.

OBJECTIVE\nTo understand if patient-provider race-concordance is associated with improved health outcomes for minorities.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA comprehensive review of published research literature (1980-2008) using MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and CINAHL databases were conducted. Studies were included if they had at least one research question examining the effect of patient-provider race-concordance on minority patients' health outcomes and pertained to minorities in the USA. The database search and data analysis were each independently conducted by two authors. The review was limited to data analysis in tabular and text format. A meta-analysis was not possible due to the discrepancy in methods and outcomes across studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Combined, the studies were based on data from 56,276 patients and only 1,756 providers. Whites/Caucasians (37.6%) and Blacks/African Americans (31.5%), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (13.3%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (4.3%) comprised the majority of the patient sample. The median sample of providers was only 16 for African Americans, 10 for Asians and two for Hispanics. The review presented mixed results. Of the 27 studies, patient-provider race-concordance was associated with positive health outcomes for minorities in only nine studies (33%), while eight studies (30%) found no association of race-concordance with the outcomes studied and 10 (37%) presented mixed findings. Analysis suggested that having a provider of same race did not improve 'receipt of services' for minorities. No clear pattern of findings emerged in the domains of healthcare utilization, patient-provider communication, preference, satisfaction, or perception of respect.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is inconclusive evidence to support that patient-provider race-concordance is associated with positive health outcomes for minorities. Studies were limited to four racial/ethnic groups and generally employed small samples of minorities. Further research is needed to understand what health outcomes may be more sensitive to cultural proximity between patients and providers, and what patient, provider and setting-level variables may moderate or mediate these outcomes."}

General comorbidity was associated with age, female gender, and limited education, but did not increase systematically with age. The frequency of psychiatric illness was higher among the somatic cases than among noncases, and the frequency of somatic morbidity among the psychiatric cases was higher than among noncases. This association between somatic and psychiatric morbidity remained statistically significant after controlling for age, gender, and education [odds ratio (OR)=1.61; confidence interval (CI)=1.38-1.88].

The ergogenic and therapeutic effects of increasing muscle creatine by supplementation are well-recognized.

The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge about the influence of creatine supplementation on brain function in healthy individuals. It appears that brain creatine is responsive to supplementation, however higher, or more prolonged dosing strategies than those typically used to increase muscle creatine, may be required to elicit an increase in brain creatine. The optimal dosing strategy to induce this response, is currently unknown, and there is an urgent need for studies investigating this. When considering the influence of supplementation strategies on cognitive processes, it appears that creatine is most likely to exert an influence in situations whereby cognitive processes are stressed, e.g. during sleep deprivation, experimental hypoxia, or during the performance of more complex, and thus more cognitively demanding tasks. Evidence exists indicating that increased brain creatine may be effective at reducing the severity of, or enhancing recovery from mild traumatic brain injury, however, only limited data in humans are available to verify this hypothesis, thus representing an exciting area for further research."}

From 1995 to 2000, telephone tests of cognitive function [Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS), delayed recall of the TICS 10-word list, immediate and delayed recall of a short paragraph, a test of verbal fluency, and a digit span backwards test] were administered to the women, who were 70-79 y of age at that time. We used linear and logistic regression models to calculate multivariate-adjusted mean differences in test scores and relative risks of a low score for specific supplement users compared with nonusers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLong-term, current users of vitamin E with vitamin C had significantly better mean performance, as judged by a global score that combined individual test scores, than did women who had never used vitamin E or C (P = 0.03); there was a trend for increasingly higher mean scores with increasing durations of use (P = 0.04). These associations were strongest among women with low dietary intakes of alpha-tocopherol. Benefits were less consistent for women taking vitamin E alone, with no evidence of higher scores with longer durations of use.

The validation sample included 197 subjects (105 women) aged 19-83 y with a BMI of 15.7-36.4. Both samples were of mixed ethnic/racial groups. All underwent whole-body magnetic resonance imaging to quantify SM (dependent variable for multiple regressions) and anthropometric variables (independent variables).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo prediction equations with high practicality and optimal derivation correlations with SM were further investigated to assess agreement and bias by using Bland-Altman plots and validated in separate data sets. Including race as a variable increased R(2) by only 0.1% in men and by 8% in women. For men: SM (kg) = 39.5 + 0.665 body weight (BW; kg) - 0.185 waist circumference (cm) - 0.418 hip circumference (cm) - 0.08 age (y) (derivation: R(2) = 0.76, SEE = 2.7 kg; validation: R(2) = 0.79, SEE = 2.7 kg). Bland-Altman plots showed moderate agreement in both derivation and validation analyses. For women: SM (kg) = 2.89 + 0.255 BW (kg) - 0.175 hip circumference (cm) - 0.038 age (y) + 0.118 height (cm) (derivation: R(2) = 0.58, SEE = 2.2 kg; validation: R(2) = 0.59, SEE = 2.1 kg). Bland-Altman plots had a negative slope, indicating a tendency to overestimate SM among women with smaller muscle mass and to underestimate SM among those with larger muscle mass.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnthropometry predicts SM better in men than in women.

BACKGROUND\nThe aims of this study were to explore the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a large sample of Australian chronically-ill patients (type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension/ischaemic heart disease), to investigate the impact of characteristics of patients and their general practitioners on their HRQoL and to examine clinically significant differences in HRQoL among males and females.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a cross-sectional study with 193 general practitioners and 2181 of their chronically-ill patients aged 18 years or more using the standard Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) version 2. SF-12 physical component score (PCS-12) and mental component score (MCS-12) were derived using the standard US algorithm. Multilevel regression analysis (patients at level 1 and general practitioners at level 2) was applied to relate PCS-12 and MCS-12 to patient and general practitioner (GP) characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEmployment was likely to have a clinically significant larger positive effect on HRQoL of males (regression coefficient (B) (PCS-12) = 7.29, P < 0.001, effect size = 1.23 and B (MCS-12) = 3.40, P < 0.01, effect size = 0.55) than that of females (B(PCS-12) = 4.05, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.78 and B (MCS-12) = 1.16, P > 0.05, effect size = 0.16). There was a clinically significant difference in HRQoL among age groups. Younger men (< 39 years) were likely to have better physical health than older men (> 59 years, B = -5.82, P < 0.05, effect size = 0.66); older women tended to have better mental health (B = 5.62, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.77) than younger women. Chronically-ill women smokers reported clinically significant (B = -3.99, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.66) poorer mental health than women who were non-smokers. Female GPs were more likely to examine female patients than male patients (33% vs. 15%, P < 0.001) and female patients attending female GPs reported better physical health (B = 1.59, P < 0.05, effect size = 0.30).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSome of the associations between patient characteristics and SF-12 physical and/or mental component scores were different for men and women. This finding underlines the importance of considering these factors in the management of chronically-ill patients in general practice. The results suggest that chronically ill women attempting to quit smoking may need more psychological support. More quantitative studies are needed to determine the association between GP gender and patient gender in relation to HRQoL."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relation of social resources and cognitive decline in older adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData are from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, an epidemiologic study of risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other common conditions in a geographically defined population of older persons. The sample consisted of 6,102 non-Hispanic African Americans (61.2%) and whites, aged > or = 65, who underwent up to three interviews during an average of 5.3 years of follow-up. Each interview included administration of four cognitive function tests from which a composite measure of cognition was formed. Social networks were based on the number of children, relatives, and friends seen at least once a month. Social engagement was measured with four items related to social and productive activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher number of social networks and level of social engagement were positively correlated with initial level of cognitive function (networks estimate = 0.003, engagement estimate = 0.060, both p < 0.001). Both resources were also associated with a reduced rate of cognitive decline. A high (90th percentile) number of networks reduced the rate of decline by 39% compared to a low level (10th percentile), and high social engagement reduced decline by 91%. These relations remained after controlling for socioeconomic status, cognitive activity, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and chronic medical conditions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGreater social resources, as defined by social networks and social engagement, are associated with reduced cognitive decline in old age."}

BACKGROUND\nParticipation in cognitively stimulating activities is hypothesized to be associated with risk of AD, but knowledge about this association is limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA biracial community in Chicago was censused, persons aged 65 years and older were asked to participate in an interview, and 6,158 of 7,826 (79%) eligible persons did so. As part of the interview, persons rated current frequency of participation in seven cognitive activities (e.g., reading a newspaper) and nine physical activities (e.g., walking for exercise) from which composite measures of cognitive and physical activity frequency were derived. Four years later, 1,249 of those judged free of AD were sampled for a detailed clinical evaluation of incident disease and 842 (74% of those eligible) participated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe composite measure of cognitive activity ranged from 1.28 to 4.71 (mean 3.30; SD 0.59), with higher scores indicating more frequent activity. A total of 139 persons met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD on clinical evaluation. In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, education, sex, race, and possession of the APOE epsilon4 allele, a one-point increase in cognitive activity score was associated with a 64% reduction in risk of incident AD (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65). By contrast, weekly hours of physical activity (mean 3.5; SD 5.1) was not related to disease risk (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10). Education was associated with risk of AD and a similar trend was present for occupation, but these effects were substantially reduced when cognitive activity was added to the model.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities appears to be associated with risk of AD and may partially explain the association of educational and occupational attainment with disease risk."}

OBJECTIVES\nThis study examined the effects of 14 days of creatine supplementation on the physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT), maximal isometric grip strength (GRIP), sit-to-stand (STS), and body weight (BW) in elderly men and women.\n\n\nDESIGN\nUsing a double blind cross-over design, fifteen men (n = 7) and women (n = 8) (age +/- SD = 74.5 +/- 6.4 yrs) were randomly assigned to either the creatine (CR) (20g.d-1 during week 1 decreasing to 10g.d-1 at week 2) or Placebo (PL) group. After a 4 to 6 week washout period, the subjects were assigned the other treatment. Before (pre) and after (post) the supplementation period, participants performed a discontinuous, cycle ergometry test to determine the PWCFT. In addition, subjects performed STS, GRIP, BW test prior to and post treatment.\n\n\nSETTING\nSoutheastern part of the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant increases in GRIP (6.7%) and PWCFT (15.6%) from pre- to post-supplementation were found for the CR (p < 0.05) treatment, but no change for the PL treatment was observed. However, no significant change (p superior 0.05) was noted for STS or BW for either treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings suggest that 14 days of CR supplementation may increase upper body grip strength and increase physical working capacity by delaying neuromuscular fatigue in the elderly men and women in this study. While more research is needed, CR supplementation may improve upper body grip strength and lower body muscle endurance which may be important for maintaining health and independent living in elderly men and women."}

PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nTo summarize recent findings and current concepts in the beneficial effects of berry consumption on brain function during aging.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nBerryfruit supplementation has continued to demonstrate efficacy in reversing age-related cognitive decline in animal studies. In terms of the mechanisms behind the effects of berries on the central nervous system, recent studies have demonstrated the bioavailability of berry polyphenols in several animal models. These studies have revealed that flavonoids and polyphenols from berries do accumulate in the brain following long-term consumption. Finally, several compelling studies have revealed that berries can influence cell-signaling cascades both in vivo and in cell culture systems. These studies underscore the developing theory that berries and antioxidant-rich foods may be acting as more than just oxygen radical neutralizers in the aging central nervous system.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nAntioxidant-rich berries consumed in the diet can positively impact learning and memory in the aged animal. This effect on cognition is thought to be due to the direct interaction of berry polyphenols with aging neurons, reducing the impact of stress-related cellular signals and increasing the capacity of neurons to maintain proper functioning during aging."}

Serum insulin was measured in 1991 and participants were grouped based on their insulin levels. Dementia was ascertained in 1991, 1994, and 1996 according to international guidelines. The 2,568 men dementia-free in 1991 were reexamined in 1994 and 1996; 244 new cases of dementia were diagnosed. Survival analysis with age as the time scale was used to estimate the risk (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% CI) for incident dementia associated with levels of insulin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe risk of dementia was increased at the two extremes of the insulin distribution (lower and upper 15th percentiles). Compared to the rest of the cohort subjects in the lowest 15th percentile and highest 15th percentile had an increased risk for dementia (HR = 1.54, CI 1.11 to 2.11 and HR = 1.54, CI 1.05 to 2.26).

OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate whether age-related and experimental reductions in SWS and sleep continuity are associated with increased daytime sleep propensity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAssessment of daytime sleep propensity under baseline conditions and following experimental disruption of SWS. Healthy young (20-30 y, n = 44), middle-aged (40-55 y, n = 35) and older (66-83 y, n = 31) men and women, completed a 2-way parallel group study. After an 8-h baseline sleep episode, subjects were randomized to 2 nights with selective SWS disruption by acoustic stimuli, or without disruption, followed by 1 recovery night. Objective and subjective sleep propensity were assessed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).\n\n\nFINDINGS\nDuring baseline sleep, SWS decreased (P < 0.001) and the number of awakenings increased (P < 0.001) across the 3 age groups. During the baseline day, MSLT values increased across the three age groups (P < 0.0001) with mean values of 8.7 min (SD: 4.5), 11.7 (5.1) and 14.2 (4.1) in the young, middle-aged, and older adults, respectively. KSS values were 3.7 (1.0), 3.2 (0.9), and 3.4 (0.6) (age-group: P = 0.031). Two nights of SWS disruption led to a reduction in MSLT and increase in KSS in all 3 age groups (SWS disruption vs. control: P < 0.05 in all cases).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHealthy aging is associated with a reduction in daytime sleep propensity, sleep continuity, and SWS. In contrast, experimental disruption of SWS leads to an increase in daytime sleep propensity. The age-related decline in SWS and reduction in daytime sleep propensity may reflect a lessening in homeostatic sleep requirement. Healthy older adults without sleep disorders can expect to be less sleepy during the daytime than young adults."}

Follow-up of incident dementia varied between 13.7 to 30.1 years depending on the cohort. People with dementia were identified through linked electronic health records and repeated clinical examinations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring 1.8 million person years at risk, 1143 people with dementia were recorded. The risk of dementia was found to be lower for participants with high compared with low cognitive stimulation at work (crude incidence of dementia per 10 000 person years 4.8 in the high stimulation group and 7.3 in the low stimulation group, age and sex adjusted hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92, heterogeneity in cohort specific estimates I2=0%, P=0.99). This association was robust to additional adjustment for education, risk factors for dementia in adulthood (smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, job strain, obesity, hypertension, and prevalent diabetes at baseline), and cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke) before dementia diagnosis (fully adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98). The risk of dementia was also observed during the first 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.95) and from year 10 onwards (0.79, 0.66 to 0.95) and replicated using a repeated job exposure matrix indicator of cognitive stimulation (hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation increase 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.86). In analysis controlling for multiple testing, higher cognitive stimulation at work was associated with lower levels of proteins that inhibit central nervous system axonogenesis and synaptogenesis: slit homologue 2 (SLIT2, fully adjusted β -0.34, P<0.001), carbohydrate sulfotransferase 12 (CHSTC, fully adjusted β -0.33, P<0.001), and peptidyl-glycine α-amidating monooxygenase (AMD, fully adjusted β -0.32, P<0.001). These proteins were associated with increased dementia risk, with the fully adjusted hazard ratio per 1 SD being 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.28) for SLIT2, 1.13 (1.00 to 1.27) for CHSTC, and 1.04 (0.97 to 1.13) for AMD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe risk of dementia in old age was found to be lower in people with cognitively stimulating jobs than in those with non-stimulating jobs. The findings that cognitive stimulation is associated with lower levels of plasma proteins that potentially inhibit axonogenesis and synaptogenesis and increase the risk of dementia might provide clues to underlying biological mechanisms."}

Other factors, such as increasing age and female sex, are also known to track with lower CRF levels. However, it is unclear how these factors together with AD diagnosis and genetic risk (apolipoprotein e4 ; APOE4) collectively affect CRF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOur primary objective was to characterize the collective relationship of age, sex, APOE4 carrier status , and cognitive status (nondemented or AD) with two commonly reported CRF outcomes, VO2 max and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES). To interrogate the unique and combined effect of age, sex, APOE4, and cognitive status on CRF, we pooled multiple datasets and tested several statistical models allowing all possible interactions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAD diagnosis was consistently associated with lower maximal CRF, which declined with increasing age. APOE4 was also associated with lower maximal CRF (VO2max), but only in male subjects. Submaximal CRF (OUES) was lower in APOE4 carriers of both sexes, although this difference converged in male subjects with advancing age.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis multi-cohort analysis (n = 304) suggests that APOE4 carrier status and sex are important considerations for studies that evaluate maximal and submaximal CRF."}

Finally, only a few medications and health supplements showed association towards a positive effect on cognitive function (anti-inflammatory agents, eg, ibuprofen breasoning 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08), breaction time 4 (3, 5); glucosamine breasoning 0.09 (0.03 to 0.14), breaction time 5 (3 to 6)).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this large volunteer study, some commonly prescribed medications were associated with poor cognitive performance. Some associations may reflect underlying diseases for which the medications were prescribed, although the analysis controlled for the possible effect of diagnosis. Other drugs, whose association cannot be linked to the effect of any disease, may need vigilance for their implications in clinical practice."}

Chromium (Cr) picolinate (CrPic) is a widely used nutritional supplement for optimal insulin function. A relationship among Cr status, diabetes, and associated pathologies has been established. Virtually all trials using CrPic supplementation for subjects with diabetes have demonstrated beneficial effects. Thirteen of 15 clinical studies (including 11 randomized, controlled studies) involving a total of 1,690 subjects (1,505 in CrPic group) reported significant improvement in at least one outcome of glycemic control. All 15 studies showed salutary effects in at least one parameter of diabetes management, including dyslipidemia. Positive outcomes from CrPic supplementation included reduced blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and reduced requirements for hypoglycemic medication. The greater bioavailability of CrPic compared with other forms of Cr (e.g., niacin-bound Cr or CrCl(3)) may explain its comparatively superior efficacy in glycemic and lipidemic control. The pooled data from studies using CrPic supplementation for type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects show substantial reductions in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which equate to a reduced risk for disease complications. Collectively, the data support the safety and therapeutic value of CrPic for the management of cholesterolemia and hyperglycemia in subjects with diabetes."}

BACKGROUND\nRecent studies suggest that trends in cardiovascular risk may result in a decrease in age-specific prevalence of dementia. Studies in rural areas are rare.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo study cohort effects in dementia prevalence and survival of people with dementia in a Swedish rural area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were from the 1995-1998 Nordanstig Project (NP) (n = 303) and the 2001-2003 Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Nordanstig (SNAC-N) (n = 384). Overall 6-year dementia prevalence and mortality in NP and SNAC-N were compared for people 78 years and older. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia occurrence using the NP study population as the reference group. Cox regression models were used to analyze time to death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe crude prevalence of dementia was 21.8% in NP and 17.4% in SNAC-N. When the NP cohort was used as the reference group, the age- and gender-adjusted OR of dementia was 0.71 (95% CI 0.48-1.04) in SNAC-N; the OR was 0.47 (0.24-0.90) for men and 0.88 (0.54-1.44) for women. In the extended model, the OR of dementia was significantly lower in SNAC-N than in the NP cohort as a whole (0.63; 0.39-0.99) and in men (0.34; 0.15-0.79), but not in women (0.81; 0.46-1.44). The Cox regression models indicated that the hazard ratio of dying was lower in the SNAC-N than NP population.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTrends toward a lower prevalence of dementia in high-income countries seem to be evident in this Swedish rural area, at least in men."}

Patients were subdivided into five year age bands up to 85 (patients aged ≥ 85 were analysed as one group) and prescribing trends across the population were assessed by estimating the proportion of patients prescribed with antihypertensive drug or statin drug, or both, in each group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 41,250 records screened in this study, 36,679 (89%) patients did not have a history of cardiovascular disease and therefore could be considered for primary preventive treatment. The proportion receiving antihypertensive drugs increased with age (from 5% (378/6978) aged 40-44 to 57% (621/1092) aged ≥ 85) as did the proportion taking statins up to the age of 74 (from 3% (201/6978) aged 40-44 to 29% (675/2367) aged 70-74).

OBJECTIVES\nWe sought to find racial differences in the effects of trust in the health care system on preventive health service use among older adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a telephone survey with 1681 Black and White older adults. Survey questions explored respondents' trust in physicians, medical research, and health information sources. We used logistic regression and controlled for covariates to assess effects of race and trust on the use of preventive health services.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 4 types of trust through factor analysis: trust in one's own personal physician, trust in the competence of physicians' care, and trust in formal and informal health information sources. Blacks had significantly less trust in their own physicians and greater trust in informal health information sources than did Whites. Greater trust in one's own physician was associated with utilization of routine checkups, prostate-specific antigen tests, and mammograms, but not with flu shots. Greater trust in informal information sources was associated with utilization of mammograms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTrust in one's own personal physician is associated with utilization of preventive health services. Blacks' relatively high distrust of their physicians likely contributes to health disparities by causing reduced utilization of preventive services.

There has been considerable interest in the use of creatine (Cr) supplementation to treat neurological disorders. However, in contrast to muscle physiology, there are relatively few studies of creatine supplementation in the brain. In this report, we use high-field MR (31)P and (1)H spectroscopic imaging of human brain with a 7-day protocol of oral Cr supplementation to examine its effects on cerebral energetics (phosphocreatine, PCr; ATP) and mitochondrial metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate, NAA; and Cr). We find an increased ratio of PCr/ATP (day 0, 0.80 +/- 0.10; day 7, 0.85 +/- 09), with this change largely due to decreased ATP, from 2.7 +/- 0.3 mM to 2.5 +/- 0.3 mM. The ratio of NAA/Cr also decreased (day 0, 1.32 +/- 0.17; day 7 1.18 +/- 0.13), primarily from increased Cr (9.6 +/- 1.9 to 10.1 +/- 2.0 mM). The Cr-induced changes significantly correlated with the basal state, with the fractional increase in PCr/ATP negatively correlating with the basal PCr/ATP value (R = -0.74, P < 0.001). As NAA is a measure of mitochondrial function, there was also a significant negative correlation between basal NAA concentrations with the fractional change in PCr and ATP. Thus healthy human brain energetics is malleable and shifts with 7 days of Cr supplementation, with the regions of initially low PCr showing the largest increments in PCr. Overall, Cr supplementation appears to improve high-energy phosphate turnover in healthy brain and can result in either a decrease or an increase in high-energy phosphate concentrations."}

PURPOSE\nCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is regarded a clinical vital sign, and accurate reference values for all age groups are essential. Little data exist on CRF and cardiorespiratory function in older adults. The aim of this study was to provide normative values for CRF and cardiorespiratory function in older adults, including people with history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn total, 1537 (769 women) participants age 70 to 77 yr underwent clinical examinations and cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2peak), ventilation (V˙Epeak), expiration of carbon dioxide (VV˙CO2peak), breathing frequency (BFpeak), tidal volume (VTpeak), oxygen pulse (O2 pulsepeak), ventilatory efficiency (EqV˙O2peak and EqV˙CO2peak), and 1-min HR recovery were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMen compared with women had higher V˙O2peak (31.3 ± 6.7 vs 26.2 ± 5.0 mL·min·kg), BFpeak (41.8 ± 8.0 vs 39.7 ± 7.1 breaths per minute), VTpeak (2.3 ± 0.5 vs 1.6 ± 0.3), O2 pulsepeak (16.4 ± 3.2 vs 11.3 ± 2.0), V˙CO2peak (2.9 ± 0.2 and 1.9 ± 0.1 L·min), V˙Epeak (96.2 ± 21.7 vs 61.1 ± 21.6 L·min), EqV˙O2peak (38.0 ± 6.9 vs 35.1 ± 5.6), and EqV˙CO2peak (33.5 ± 5.7 vs 31.9 ± 4.5). Women and men with CVD had lower V˙O2peak (14% and 19%), peak HR (5% and 6%), V˙Epeak (8% and 10%), VTpeak (7% and 4%), and lower EqV˙CO2peak (4% and 6%) compared with their healthy counterparts, respectively. Compared with healthy women and men, 1-min HR recovery was 12% and 16% lower for women and men with CVD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study represents the largest reference material on directly measured CRF and cardiorespiratory function in older men and women, with and without CVD.

Although, better known for its role in inflammation, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) has more recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. This has been, in part, to the discovery of its localization not just in glia, cells that are integral to mediating the inflammatory process in the brain, but also neurons. Several effectors of neuronal NF-κB have been identified, including calcium, inflammatory cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor alpha), and the induction of experimental paradigms thought to reflect learning and memory at the cellular level (i.e., long-term potentiation). NF-κB is also activated after learning and memory formation in vivo. In turn, activation of NF-κB can elicit either suppression or activation of other genes. Studies are only beginning to elucidate the multitude of neuronal gene targets of NF-κB in the normal brain, but research to date has confirmed targets involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell signaling and growth, neurotransmission, redox signaling, and gene regulation. Further, several lines of research confirm dysregulation of NF-κB in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disorder characterized clinically by a profound deficit in the ability to form new memories. AD-related neuropathology includes the characteristic amyloid beta plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles. Although, such neuropathological findings have been hypothesized to contribute to memory deficits in AD, research has identified perturbations at the cellular and synaptic level that occur even prior to more gross pathologies, including transcriptional dysregulation. Indeed, synaptic disturbances appear to be a significant correlate of cognitive deficits in AD. Given the more recently identified role for NF-κB in memory and synaptic transmission in the normal brain, the expansive network of gene targets of NF-κB, and its dysregulation in AD, a thorough understanding of NF-κB-related signaling in AD is warranted and may have important implications for uncovering treatments for the disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive view of our current understanding of the gene targets of this transcription factor in neurons in the intact brain and provide an overview of studies investigating NF-κB signaling, including its downstream targets, in the AD brain as a means of uncovering the basic physiological mechanisms by which memory becomes fragile in the disease."}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug developments and clinical trials (CT) remain vulnerable to problems that undermine research validity. Investigations of CT methods reveal how numerous factors decrease active drug-placebo group differences and increase variance, thereby reducing power to reach statistical significance for outcome measure differences in AD CTs. Such factors include, amongst many, inaccuracy, imprecision, bias, failures to follow or lack of operational protocols for applying CT methods, inter-site variance, and lack of homogeneous sampling using disorder criteria. After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice."}

Abundant evidence not only demonstrates the full spectrum of oxidative damage to neuronal macromolecules, but also reveals the occurrence of oxidative events early in the course of the disease and prior to the formation of the pathology, which support an important role of oxidative stress in AD. As a disease of abnormal aging, AD demonstrates oxidative damage at levels that significantly surpass that of elderly controls, which suggests the involvement of additional factor(s). Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria, which are more proficient at producing reactive oxygen species but less so in ATP, are also an early and prominent feature of the disease. Since mitochondria are also vulnerable to oxidative stress, it is likely that a vicious downward spiral involving the interactions between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contributes to the initiation and/or amplification of reactive oxygen species that is critical to the pathogenesis of AD."}

After the injection, the AdCr+ group received a diet of 2% creatine for six weeks. The control group underwent no surgical or dietary intervention. After six weeks the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was administered, to measure learning and memory retrieval. After sacrificing the animals, TUNEL staining for an anti-apoptosis assay was performed for the sham, AdCr+, and AdCr- groups. All groups were compared by independent ttest using SPSS software.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRESULTS of MWM show that rats in sham and control groups performed better than those in the AdCr- and AdCr+ groups. Compared to sham group, AdCr+ and AdCr- groups had more TUNEL positive neurons count. RESULTS indicated no differences between the AdCr+ and AdCrgroups in learning, memory retrieval, and percentage of TUNEL positive neurons.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAfter Aβ injection, creatine supplementation had no effect on learning, memory retrieval, or neuron apoptosis in male Wistar rats."}

BACKGROUND\nWe investigated the effects of sleep deprivation with or without acute supplementation of caffeine or creatine on the execution of a repeated rugby passing skill.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTen elite rugby players completed 10 trials on a simple rugby passing skill test (20 repeats per trial), following a period of familiarisation. The players had between 7-9 h sleep on 5 of these trials and between 3-5 h sleep (deprivation) on the other 5. At a time of 1.5 h before each trial, they undertook administration of either: placebo tablets, 50 or 100 mg/kg creatine, 1 or 5 mg/kg caffeine.

Genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) are associated with an increase in oxidative stress, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved at an early stage of the pathologic cascade. Moreover, oxidative stress is mechanistically and chronologically associated with other key features of AD, namely, metabolic, mitochondrial, metal, and cell-cycle abnormalities. Contrary to the commonly held notion that pathologic hallmarks of AD signify etiology, several lines of evidence now indicate that aggregation of amyloid-beta and tau is a compensatory response to underlying oxidative stress. Therefore, removal of proteinaceous accumulations may treat the epiphenomenon rather than the disease and may actually enhance oxidative damage. Although some antioxidants have been shown to reduce the incidence of AD, the magnitude of the effect may be modified by individual factors such as genetic predisposition (e.g. apolipoprotein E genotype) and habitual behaviors. Because caloric restriction, exercise, and intellectual activity have been experimentally shown to promote neuronal survival through enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses, a combination of dietary regimen of low total calorie and rich antioxidant nutrients and maintaining physical and intellectual activities may ultimately prove to be one of the most efficacious strategies for AD prevention."}

BACKGROUND/AIMS\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Interestingly, muscle mass (MM) and muscle strength (MS) are related to AD. In addition to the muscle profile, brain atrophy is also a prominent feature of AD. There is substantial evidence showing an association between muscle profile and dementia, but the role of the muscle profile and cerebral cortical atrophy within this association is less well understood. The objective of this study was to determine if there is any association between muscle profile and brain regional volume in AD. A secondary objective was to determine whether this relationship continues as the clinical stage of AD progresses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 28 patients with probable AD without weakness. We assessed the patients' basic demographic characteristics, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and brain magnetic resonance images. MM was measured using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MS was assessed in Nm/kg with an isokinetic knee extensor using an isokinetic device at an angular velocity of 60°/s. An automatic analysis program was used for brain regional volumetric measurements. Dementia was divided into two stages: mild and moderate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMS was related to left hippocampal volume ratio. After adjusting for age and cognitive status, the relationship remained. MS did not demonstrate any relationship to any brain regional volume ratio in the mild stage; however, in the moderate stage, it was positively related to both the right and the left hippocampal volume ratio.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings imply a shared underlying pathology relating MS and brain volume and suggest cognitive functional declines through the muscle-brain axis. Further longitudinal studies are needed to find possible and related causes of reduced MS and cortical atrophy in patients with dementia."}

PURPOSE\nTo determine whether low-dose creatine and protein supplementation during resistance training (RT; 3 d x wk(-1); 10 wk) in older men (59-77 yr) is effective for improving strength and muscle mass without producing potentially cytotoxic metabolites (formaldehyde).\n\n\nMETHODS\nOlder men were randomized (double-blind) to receive 0.1 g x kg(-1) creatine + 0.3 g x kg(-1) protein (CP; n = 10), creatine (C; n = 13), or placebo (PLA; n = 12) on training days. Measurements before and after RT included lean tissue mass (air-displacement plethysmography), muscle thickness (ultrasound) of elbow, knee, and ankle flexors and extensors, leg and bench press strength, and urinary indicators of cytotoxicity (formaldehyde), myofibrillar protein degradation [3-methylhistidine (3-MH)],and bone resorption [cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx)].\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects in C and CP groups combined experienced greater increases in body mass and total muscle thickness than PLA (P < 0.05). Subjects who received CP increased lean tissue mass (+5.6%) more than C (+2.2%) or PLA (+1.0%; P < 0.05) and increased bench press strength (+25%) to a greater extent than C and PLA combined (+12.5%; P < 0.05). CP and C did not differ from PLA for changes in formaldehyde production (+24% each).

Defect of autophagy is common to many neurodegenerative disorders because it serves as a major degradation pathway for the clearance of various aggregate-prone proteins. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is recognized as the most important negative regulator of autophagy, is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of mTOR and its dependent autophagy in normal brain during aging remains unknown. Furthermore, caloric restriction (CR) is frequently used as a tool to study mechanisms behind aging and age-associated diseases because CR can prevent age-related diseases and prolong lifespan in several model organisms. Inhibiting mTOR and promoting autophagy activity play roles in aging delayed by CR. However, whether CR can ameliorate age-related cognition deficits by inhibiting mTOR and activate autophagy in hippocampus needs to be further investigated. Here we showed a decline of autophagic degradation in mice hippocampus in correlation with age-dependent cognitive dysfunction, whereas the activity of mTOR and its upstream brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling was decreased with aging. In addition, facilitating the mTOR pathway successfully declines and sustains autophagic degradation with aging in hippocampus by CR treatment and is involved in CR by ameliorating age-related cognitive deficits."}

Fourteen weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in significant increases in all measurements of strength and functional tasks and muscle fiber area for both groups (p <.05). CrM supplementation resulted in significantly greater increases in fat-free mass and total body mass, as compared with placebo (p <.05).

Patients with schizophrenia had a statistically significant reduction in Cr levels as compared with controls; bipolar disorder patients showed no difference in Cr as compared with controls. In addition, older age was associated with reductions in Cr in healthy controls, but not in patients with either disorder.

The specific CK BB activity and protein carbonyl content were determined in brain extracts of six AD and six age-matched control subjects. CK BB activity per microgram of immunoreactive CK BB protein was lower in AD than in control brain extracts, indicating the presence of inactive CK BB molecules. The analysis of specific protein carbonyl levels in CK BB, performed by two-dimensional fingerprinting of oxidatively modified proteins, identified CK BB as one of the targets of protein oxidation in the AD brain. The increase of protein carbonyl content in CK BB provides evidence that oxidative posttranslational modification of CK BB plays a role in the loss of CK BB activity in AD."}

BACKGROUND\nAdherence to a Mediterranean diet may improve longevity, but relevant data are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a population-based, prospective investigation involving 22,043 adults in Greece who completed an extensive, validated, food-frequency questionnaire at base line. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed by a 10-point Mediterranean-diet scale that incorporated the salient characteristics of this diet (range of scores, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater adherence). We used proportional-hazards regression to assess the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality, as well as mortality due to coronary heart disease and mortality due to cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index, physical-activity level, and other potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring a median of 44 months of follow-up, there were 275 deaths. A higher degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduction in total mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for death associated with a two-point increment in the Mediterranean-diet score, 0.75 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.87]). An inverse association with greater adherence to this diet was evident for both death due to coronary heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.94]) and death due to cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98]).

PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this article was to describe effective recruitment and retention strategies used in a community-based intervention study for older, rural African American women with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study's design was a randomized control test using a 3-group experimental design in a sample of 180 older, rural African American women (55 years of age and older), with type 2 diabetes. The study employed a range of strategies to successfully recruit and retain older African American women. These strategies were initially developed based on a review of the literature and the investigators' prior experience. They were modified as the research progressed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore than a quarter of the participants were recruited from outpatient clinics. In-person outreach to health care providers was essential to engage and retain their help in recruiting patients. The research team made it easy and rewarding for women to participate in the study by providing a toll-free phone number, culturally appropriate intervention materials, intervention in the home, and incentives. Developing a relationship of trust with participants and the community was critical throughout the study period. Through the use of these strategies, the target enrollment of 180 women was met with 91% retention rate at the completion of the study.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of multiple strategies can enhance recruitment and retention of rural, older African American women into a research study. Strategies are most effective when they build a relationship of trust with participants and the community and make it easy and rewarding for women to participate."}

BACKGROUND\nHigher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is cross-sectionally associated with more conserved brain volume in older age, but longitudinal studies are rare. This study examined whether higher midlife CRF was prospectively associated with slower atrophy, which in turn was associated with higher late-life CRF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBrain volume by magnetic resonance imaging was determined annually from 1994 to 2003 in 146 participants (M baseline age = 69.6 years). Peak oxygen uptake on a treadmill yielded estimated midlife CRF in 138 and late-life CRF in 73 participants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher midlife CRF was associated with greater middle temporal gyrus, perirhinal cortex, and temporal and parietal white matter, but was not associated with atrophy progression. Slower atrophy in middle frontal and angular gyri was associated with higher late-life CRF, independent of CRF at baseline magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher midlife CRF may play a role in preserving middle and medial temporal volumes in late adulthood. Slower atrophy in middle frontal and angular gyri may predict late-life CRF."}

Calorie restriction (CR) is a potent modulator of longevity in multiple species. A growing body of evidence shows that sustained periods of CR without malnutrition improves risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders in humans. Innovative dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have recently emerged as alternative approaches that improve markers of aging. Some of these newer strategies might provide benefits for healthy aging with little to no CR and therefore, compared to traditional CR, may be easier to follow. Further to providing an update of CR studies in humans, the present narrative review appraises the influence of these contemporary dietary strategies on mechanisms posited to drive CR-induced longevity in humans, including those involving energy metabolism, oxidative damage, inﬂammation, glucose homeostasis, and functional changes in the neuroendocrine systems. The review also discusses the utilization of these diets for populations in the current obesogenic environment, and comments on whether current research can inform an optimal diet that attenuates aging, can be easily followed, and promises to improve longevity in humans."}

BACKGROUND\nEnterolignans are important biomarkers of microbiota diversity, with higher levels indicating greater diversity. Diet and inflammation have been shown to play a role in maintaining microbiota diversity. This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) has an impact on levels of urinary enterolignans in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2008. We also carried out construct validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nData came from NHANES 2003-2008. Enterolignans [enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL)] and CRP were assayed from urine and serum specimens, respectively. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores were calculated from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear and logistic regression for enterolignans, and logistic regression for CRP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter multivariable adjustment, higher E-DII scores (i.e., indicating a relatively more pro-inflammatory diet) were associated with lower levels of creatinine-normalized END [beta coefficient (b)DIIquartile4vs1 = - 1.22; 95% CI = - 0.69, - 1.74; Ptrend ≤ 0.001] and ENL (bDIIquartile4vs1 = - 7.80; 95% CI = - 5.33, - 10.26; Ptrend ≤ 0.001).

In this same sample, the E-DII also was associated with CRP ≥ 3 mg/l (ORDIIcontinuous = 1.12; 95% CI 1.05, 1.19).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn these NHANES data, there was an association between E-DII score and enterolignans. This study also provided construct validation of the E-DII using CRP in a nationally representative sample. The results indicate that dietary inflammatory potential is associated with urinary enterolignans, a potential marker for microbiota diversity.

Findings at one year showed that the treatment group had significantly lower scores on overload and depression than the control group.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThese results demonstrate that use of adult day care by caregivers of dementia patients results in lower levels of caregiving-related stress and better psychological well-being when compared to that of controls."}

This paper reports the results of the application of the contingent valuation method (CVM) to determine a monetary value of informal care. We discuss the current practice in valuing informal care and a theoretical model of the costs and benefits related to the provision of informal care. In addition, we developed a survey in which informal caregivers' willingness to accept (WTA) to provide an additional hour of informal care was elicited. This method is better than normally recommended valuation methods able to capture the heterogeneity and dynamics of informal care. Data were obtained from postal surveys. A total of 153 informal caregivers and 149 care recipients with rheumatoid arthritis returned a completed survey. Informal caregivers reported a mean WTA to provide a hypothetical additional hour of informal care of 9.52 Euro (n=124). Many hypotheses derived from the theoretical model and the literature were supported by the data.CVM is a promising alternative for existing methods like the opportunity cost method and the proxy good method to determine a monetary value of informal care that can be incorporated in the numerator of any economic evaluation."}

BACKGROUND\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to AD.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine whether several markers of inflammation are associated with cognitive decline in African-American and white well-functioning elders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors studied 3,031 African-American and white men and women (mean age 74 years) enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) were measured at baseline; cognition was assessed with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive decline was defined as a decline of >5 points.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn age-adjusted analyses, participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 or CRP performed nearly 2 points lower (worse) on baseline and follow-up 3MS (p < 0.001 for all) and declined by almost 1 point over the >2 years (p = 0.01 for IL-6 and p = 0.04 for CRP) compared with those in the lowest tertile. After multivariate adjustment, 3MS scores among participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 and CRP were similar at baseline but remained significantly lower at follow-up (p < or = 0.05 for both). Those in the highest inflammatory marker tertile were also more likely to have cognitive decline compared with the lowest tertile for IL-6 (26 vs 20%; age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.69) and for CRP (24 vs 19%; OR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.79) but not for TNFalpha (23 vs 21%; OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43). There was no significant interaction between race and inflammatory marker or between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and inflammatory marker on cognition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSerum markers of inflammation, especially IL-6 and CRP, are prospectively associated with cognitive decline in well-functioning elders. These findings support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to cognitive decline in the elderly."}

This association was evident across the normal birthweight range (>2.5 kg) and so was not accounted for exclusively by low birth weight. The association was also observed at ages 11, 15, and 26, and weakly at age 43, although these associations were dependent on the association at age 8. Birth weight was also associated with education, with those of higher birth weight more likely to have achieved higher qualifications, and this effect was accounted for partly by cognitive function at age 8.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBirth weight was associated with cognitive ability at age 8 in the general population, and in the normal birthweight range. The effect at this age largely explains associations between birth weight and cognitive function at subsequent ages. Similarly, the association between birth weight and education was accounted for partly by earlier cognitive scores."}

Recruitment for the genetic study was done in partnership with a Black-owned radio station. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts, guided by the integrated behavior model (IBM), identified self-reported motivations for participating in this care-focused and community-promoted research program. Findings revealed that decisions to enroll were influenced by strong instrumental attitudes regarding learning more about personal health and contributing to future care options for others. Notable normative influences that factored into participants' decisions to enroll in the study included hearing about the study from a respected community media outlet, friends, and family. About one-third of respondents discussed past and current racial discrimination in medical research as an important sociocultural frame within which they thought about participation, suggesting that experiential attitudes play a continuing role in AA's decisions to enroll in medical research studies.

Background: Past studies have suggested that higher lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) levels in serum and in the central nervous system (as quantified by measuring macular pigment optical density, MPOD) are related to improved cognitive function in older adults. Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p < 0.04), reasoning ability (p < 0.05) and complex attention (p < 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations."}

We have conducted a systematic review of home telecare for frail elderly people and for patients with chronic conditions.

We identified summaries of 8666 studies, which were assessed independently for relevance by two reviewers. Randomized controlled trials of any size and observational studies with 80 or more participants were eligible for inclusion if they examined the effects of using telecommunications technology to (a) monitor vital signs or safety and security in the home, or (b) provide information and support. The review included 68 randomized controlled trials (69%) and 30 observational studies with 80 or more participants (31%). Most studies focused on people with diabetes (31%) or heart failure (29%). Almost two-thirds (64%) of the studies originated in the US; more than half (55%) had been published within the previous three years. Based on the evidence reviewed, the most effective telecare interventions appear to be automated vital signs monitoring (for reducing health service use) and telephone follow-up by nurses (for improving clinical indicators and reducing health service use). The cost-effectiveness of these interventions was less certain. There is insufficient evidence about the effects of home safety and security alert systems. It is important to note that just because there is insufficient evidence about some interventions, this does not mean that those interventions have no effect."}

BACKGROUND\nMany Alzheimer's disease patients in clinical practice are on polypharmacy for treatment of comorbidities.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWhile pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs have been relatively well established with corresponding treatment guidelines, many medications and common genotype variants also affect central brain circuits involved in cognitive trajectory, leading to complex pharmacodynamic interactions and a large variability in clinical trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe applied a mechanism-based and ADAS-Cog calibrated Quantitative Systems Pharmacology biophysical model of neuronal circuits relevant for cognition in Alzheimer's disease, to standard-of-care cholinergic therapy with COMTVal158Met, 5-HTTLPR rs25531, and APOE genotypes and with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, all together 9,585 combinations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model predicts a variability of up to 14 points on ADAS-Cog at baseline (COMTVV 5-HTTLPRss APOE 4/4 combination is worst) and a four-fold range for the rate of progression. The progression rate is inversely proportional to baseline ADAS-Cog. Antidepressants, benzodiazepines, first-generation more than second generation, and most antipsychotics with the exception of aripiprazole worsen the outcome when added to standard-of-care in mild cases. Low dose second-generation benzodiazepines revert the negative effects of risperidone and olanzapine, but only in mild stages. Non APOE4 carriers with a COMTMM and 5HTTLPRLL are predicted to have the best cognitive performance at baseline but deteriorate somewhat faster over time. However, this effect is significantly modulated by comedications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnce these simulations are validated, the platform can in principle provide optimal treatment guidance in clinical practice at an individual patient level, identify negative pharmacodynamic interactions with novel targets and address protocol amendments in clinical trials."}

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the association of dietary magnesium (Mg) intake with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the general population.\n\n\nSUBJECTS/METHODS\nObservational and experimental studies through February 2013 were reviewed in PubMed and EMBASE. Additional information was retrieved through Google or hand search of related reference lists. The main outcome is either adjusted geometric mean of CRP or odds ratio (OR) of having serum CRP ≥ 3 mg/l. Meta-regression was used to determine the linear association of dietary Mg intake and adjusted geometric means of CRP levels. A fixed-effects model was used to pool ORs of interest, comparing those in the lowest with those in the highest group of dietary Mg intake.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA data set derived from seven cross-sectional studies including 32,918 participants was quantitatively assessed. A weighted inverse association between Mg intake and serum CRP levels was observed (β-coefficient: -0.0028; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.0043 to -0.0013; P(trend) = 0.001) from four cross-sectional studies. The pooled OR (95% CI) of having CRP ≥ 3 mg/l was 1.49 (1.18-1.89) on comparing the lowest to the highest group of Mg intake from three studies with the data available. Qualitative assessment among five intervention studies also showed a potential beneficial effect of Mg intake on serum CRP levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis and systematic review indicates that dietary Mg intake is significantly and inversely associated with serum CRP levels. The potential beneficial effect of Mg intake on chronic diseases may be, at least in part, explained by inhibiting inflammation."}

Background\nThe study aimed to identify the effects of modeling procedures on bacterial communities and to investigate whether different modeling procedures lead to consistent patterns of gut microbiome compositions.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat models maternal separation (MS) alone and multiple-early-adversity modeling (MAM) were established and the gut microbiome were analyzed using 16S-rRNA-based high-throughput sequencing methods.\n\n\nResults\nRats from both models exhibited visceral hypersensitivity and the two model groups exhibited differences in the extent of visceral sensitivity and fecal water content. The microbial community structure of the two models exhibited significant differences compared to the controls, while the two model groups also exhibited significant differences between them. Furthermore, microbial community functional predictions suggested that the two models exhibited different abundances of metabolisms and pathways. Several common and distinct characteristic differences were also observed between the two model groups. Alloprevotella were more abundant in both model groups, while Butyricicoccus, Turicibacter, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto along with the family it belongs to were less abundant relative to controls. In addition, the abundance of Clostridium_IV, Corynebacterium, Rothia, Elusimicrobium, Romboutsia, Allobaculum, Parasutterella, and their related taxa were specifically associated with MS group, whereas Butyricimonas and Vampirovibrio along with its related taxa were specifically associated with MAM group.

Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of CRF to traditional risk factors significantly improves the reclassification of risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve risk prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for risk classification presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient management and to encourage lifestyle-based strategies designed to reduce cardiovascular risk. These opportunities must be realized to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence meet the American Heart Association's 2020 goals."}

Low total cholesterol levels before the intervention were associated with an improvement of logical memory scores (p<.05), and a higher level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly related to improved ADAS-cog scores (p<.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nThe results suggested that an exercise intervention is beneficial for improving logical memory and maintaining general cognitive function and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy in older adults with amnestic MCI. Low total cholesterol and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. Further studies are required to determine the positive effects of exercise on cognitive function in older adults with MCI.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nUMIN-CTR UMIN000003662 ctr.cgi&quest;function&hairsp;&equals;&hairsp;brows&action&hairsp;&equals;&hairsp;brows&type&hairsp;&equals;&hairsp;summary&recptno&hairsp;&equals;&hairsp;R000004436&language&hairsp;&equals;&hairsp;J."}

Intermittent fasting (IF; reduced meal frequency) and caloric restriction (CR) extend lifespan and increase resistance to age-related diseases in rodents and monkeys and improve the health of overweight humans. Both IF and CR enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity. Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms--reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span."}

BACKGROUND\nIncreasing the proportion of subjects allocated to the experimental treatment in controlled clinical trials is often advocated as a method of increasing recruitment rates and improving the performance of trials. The presumption is that the higher likelihood of randomization to the experimental treatment will be perceived by potential study enrollees as an added benefit of participation and will increase recruitment rates and speed the completion of trials. However, studies with alternative allocation ratios require a larger sample size to maintain statistical power, which may result in a net increase in time required to complete recruitment and a net increase in total trial cost.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo describe the potential net effect of alternative allocation ratios on recruitment time and trial cost.\n\n\nMETHODS\nModels of recruitment time and trial cost were developed and used to compare trials with 1:1 allocation to trials with alternative allocation ratios under a range of per subject costs, per day costs, and enrollment rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn regard to time required to complete recruitment, alternative allocation ratios are net beneficial if the recruitment rate improves by more than about 4% for trials with a 1.5:1 allocation ratio and 12% for trials with a 2:1 allocation ratio. More substantial improvements in recruitment rate, 13 and 47% respectively for scenarios we considered, are required for alternative allocation to be net beneficial in terms of tangible monetary cost.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe cost models were developed expressly for trials comparing proportions or means across treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing alternative allocation ratio designs to improve recruitment may or may not be time and cost-effective. Using alternative allocation for this purpose should only be considered for trial contexts where there is both clear evidence that the alternative design does improve recruitment rates and the attained time or cost efficiency justifies the added study subject burden implied by a larger sample size."}

AIMS\nA discussion of the existence, prevalence and characteristics of the nocebo effect in health care.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThere is increasing but inconsistent evidence for nocebo effects (the opposite of placebo). Causal mechanisms are believed to be similar to placebo (negative effects result from suggestions of negative clinical outcomes). Risk screening in health care may produce this unintended effect through labelling some patients as high risk. Given health care's almost universal coverage this potentially affects many people.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDiscussion paper following a scoping review of the existence and frequency of nocebo.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nLiterature databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CCTR, CINAHL and EMBASE) searched from inception dates to 2013.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nSignificant empirical evidence indicates that negative beliefs may impact on health outcomes (incidence estimates range from 3-27%). The nocebo effect, rooted in the complex interplay between physiological functioning and social factors, appears significantly more common among women and where prior negative knowledge or expectations exist. Pre-existing psychological characteristics (anxiety, neuroses, panic disorder or pessimism) exacerbate it.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile the placebo effect is well documented, there has been no systematic attempt to synthesize primary empirical research on the role of nocebo. It is possible that nocebo outcomes may be preventable through careful consideration of information provision and the prior identification of potentially high risk individuals. This paper summarizes the scale and importance of the nocebo effect, its distribution according to a range of social and clinical variables and its known relation to psychological precursors. It identifies important gaps in the research literature."}

OBJECTIVES\nThe EQ-5D is a preference-based measure of health and is increasingly being used in the evaluation of health technologies. A 'tariff' of values for all 243 EQ-5D health states has been generated using direct valuations on a subset of these states. The tariff is used to express the value of differences between health states, and so this paper explores whether a tariff with better predictive ability can be calculated using differences between values rather than using the values themselves.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe original tariff (reported in this journal) was based on valuations for 42 EQ-5D states elicited from a representative sample of 2997 members of the UK general population using the time trade-off method. This same data are used to estimate a tariff based upon the differences in value between the worst possible state (33333) and all other states.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA simple model that fits the data well is one in which the differences in value between 33333 and all other states are explained in terms of the change in each dimension plus a term to pick up whether some dimensions change by the maximum amount whereas others do not change at all. The mean absolute difference between the actual values and those predicted by this model is 0.03 (compared with 0.039 in the original model).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe model presented in this paper predicts the difference between 33333 and all other states remarkably well and can be used to generate a tariff for all EQ-5D health states. In fact, this model more accurately predicts the values of states for which there are direct observations, and so we recommend its comparison with the original model in evaluative studies."}

Mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is an intrinsic property of all mitochondria and may have evolved to protect cells against the production of damaging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, compounds that enhance mitochondrial uncoupling are potentially attractive anti-aging therapies; however, chronic ingestion is associated with a number of unwanted side effects. We have previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-directed and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides by causing a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial inefficiency. Here, we sought to leverage the higher therapeutic index of CRMP to test whether mild mitochondrial uncoupling in a liver-directed fashion could reduce oxidative damage and improve age-related metabolic disease and lifespan in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration of CRMP (20 mg/[kg-day] × 4 weeks) reduced hepatic lipid content, protein kinase C epsilon activation, and hepatic insulin resistance in aged (74-week-old) high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J male mice, independently of changes in body weight, whole-body energy expenditure, food intake, or markers of hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis. CRMP treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in hepatic lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and inflammation. Importantly, long-term (49 weeks) hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling initiated late in life (94-104 weeks), in conjugation with HFD feeding, protected mice against neoplastic disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a strain and sex-specific manner. Taken together, these studies illustrate the complex variation of aging and provide important proof-of-concept data to support further studies investigating the use of liver-directed mitochondrial uncouplers to promote healthy aging in humans."}

The proliferation of Medicare Advantage plans has given Medicare enrollees more choices, but these could be overwhelming for some, especially for those with impaired decision-making capabilities. We analyzed national survey data and linked Medicare enrollment data for the period 2004-07 to examine the effects on enrollment of expanded choices and benefits in the Medicare Advantage program. The availability of more plan options was associated with increased enrollment in Medicare Advantage when elderly Medicare beneficiaries chose from a limited number of plans-for example, fewer than fifteen plans. Enrollment was unchanged or decreased in Medicare Advantage when beneficiaries chose from larger numbers of plans-for example, fifteen to thirty, or more than thirty. Elderly adults with low cognitive function were less responsive to the generosity of available benefits than those with high cognitive function when choosing between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Simplifying choices in Medicare Advantage could improve beneficiaries' enrollment decisions, strengthen value-based competition among plans, and extend the benefits of choice to seniors with impaired cognition. It could also lower their out-of-pocket costs."}

Magnesium (Mg) ions directly influence vascular tone and responsiveness and are cofactors for acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Alterations in extracellular Mg are able to modify the formation and release of nitric oxide (NO), altering arterial smooth muscle tone. Previous in vivo studies in humans have shown that parenteral or oral Mg supplementation increase endothelial-dependent vasodilation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Mg oral supplementation on endothelial function in elderly diabetic and hypertensive subjects. Sixty elderly (≥ 65 years) diabetic patients were recruited (mean age: 71.1 ± 6.1 years; M/F: 35/25). Endothelial function, evaluated by non-invasive flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, as well as anthropometric and laboratory data, including ionized Mg (Mg-ion), were measured in all patients before and after one-month. Thirty patients underwent oral Mg supplementation with 4.5 g/day of Mg pidolate (368 mg/day of Mg ion), while the rest were used as a control group. The usual management of diabetes and hypertension was not changed during the month of study participation for all the patients. In the group of patients that underwent Mg supplementation, Mg-ion concentration significantly increased from 0.42 ± 0.05 mmol/L to 0.49 ± 0.06 mmol/L; p < 0.05. Mg intervention resulted in a significant improvement of the post-ischemic endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (from 3.3 ± 3.6% to 8.4 ± 3.9%; p < 0.05). No significant differences were found, either in ion-Mg or endothelial function, in the control group. In conclusion, the present study suggests that oral Mg improves endothelial function in diabetic elderly subjects."}

There is epidemiologic and imaging evidence for the presence of cognitive reserve, but the neurophysiologic substrate of CR has not been established. In order to test the hypothesis that CR is related to aspects of neural processing, we used fMRI to image 19 healthy young adults while they performed a nonverbal recognition test. There were two task conditions. A low demand condition required encoding and recognition of single items and a titrated demand condition required the subject to encode and then recognize a larger list of items, with the study list size for each subject adjusted prior to scanning such that recognition accuracy was 75%. We hypothesized that individual differences in cognitive reserve are related to changes in neural activity as subjects moved from the low to the titrated demand task. To test this, we examined the correlation between subjects' fMRI activation and NART scores. This analysis was implemented voxel-wise in a whole brain fMRI dataset. During both the study and test phases of the recognition memory task we noted areas where, across subjects, there were significant positive and negative correlations between change in activation from low to titrated demand and the NART score. These correlations support our hypothesis that neural processing differs across individuals as a function of CR. This differential processing may help explain individual differences in capacity, and may underlie reserve against age-related or other pathologic changes."}

BACKGROUND\nThe metabolic syndrome is thought to be a contributor to coronary heart disease (CHD), and components of the syndrome have been identified as possible therapeutic targets. Previous data implicate neurohumoral activation related to psychosocial stress as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcendental meditation (TM) on components of the metabolic syndrome and CHD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 weeks of TM or active control treatment (health education), matched for frequency and time, at an academic medical center in a total of 103 subjects with stable CHD. Main outcome measures included blood pressure, lipoprotein profile, and insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (calculated as follows: [(fasting plasma glucose level [in milligrams per deciliter] x fasting plasma insulin level [in microunits per milliliter]) x 0.0552]/22.5); endothelial function measured by brachial artery reactivity testing; and cardiac autonomic system activity measured by heart rate variability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe TM group had beneficial changes (measured as mean +/- SD) in adjusted systolic blood pressure (-3.4 +/- 2.0 vs 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg; P = .04), insulin resistance (-0.75 +/- 2.04 vs 0.52 +/- 2.84; P = .01), and heart rate variability (0.10 +/- 0.17 vs -0.50 +/- 0.17 high-frequency power; P = .07) compared with the health education group, respectively. There was no effect of brachial artery reactivity testing.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of TM for 16 weeks in CHD patients improved blood pressure and insulin resistance components of the metabolic syndrome as well as cardiac autonomic nervous system tone compared with a control group receiving health education. These results suggest that TM may modulate the physiological response to stress and improve CHD risk factors, which may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CHD."}

A Bayesian approach to this problem is presented using data from previous meta-analyses in the same therapeutic area to formulate a prior distribution for the heterogeneity. The treatment difference parameters are given non-informative priors. Further, related trials which compare one or other of the treatments of interest with a common third treatment are included in the model to improve inference on both the heterogeneity and the treatment difference. Two approaches to estimating relative efficacy are considered, namely a general parametric approach and a method explicit to binary data.

AIM\nThe present randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of different exercise training modalities on functional fitness responses in apparently healthy older men.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 59 community-dwelling older men were randomly assigned to an aerobic training group (ATG, n=19), a combined aerobic and resistance training group (CTG, n=20) or a control group (n=20). Both exercise training programs were moderate-to-vigorous intensity, 3 days/week for 9 months. Six independent functional fitness tests (back scratch, chair sit-and-reach, 30-s chair stand, arm curl, 8-ft up-and-go, 6-min walk) were measured on five different occasions. The data were analyzed using a mixed-model ANOVA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nANOVA showed a significant main effect of group (P<0.001) for all functional fitness tests, with significant differences between both training groups and controls. However, the ATG only improved the chair sit-and-reach and the 30-s chair stand performance, whereas CTG improved in all functional fitness tests.

This study was to investigate CHP prescription patterns in Taiwan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out a cross-sectional analysis on a cohort of 200,000 patients based on 2004 data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) reimbursement database. Data mining techniques were applied to explore CHP co-prescription patterns.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 46,938 patients had been prescribed CHPs on at least one occasion in 2004. Patients using CHPs were generally female and middle-aged, made more outpatient visits, had fewer hospitalizations and consumed more medical resources than non-users of CHPs. A total of 1,073,030 CHPs were contained within 220,123 prescriptions, for which acute nasopharyngitis was the most common indication. Yan hu suo and Jia Wei Xiao Yao San were the most frequently prescribed single herb (SH) and herbal formula (HF), respectively. The results of the data mining showed that the best predictions were provided by co-prescriptions of 'Mo yao and Ru xiang', 'Ye jiao teng and Suan Zao Ren Tan' and 'Dang Gui Nian Tong Tang and Shu Jing Huo Xue Tang' in the groups of SH-SH, SH-HF and HF-HF, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides national-level CHP prescription profiles and utilization rates, and documents, for the first time, HF-HF prescription combinations in Chinese medicine (CM) practices in Taiwan.

INTRODUCTION\nIt has been estimated that a 10%-25% reduction in seven key risk factors could potentially prevent 1.1-3.0 million Alzheimer's disease cases globally. In addition, as dementia is preceded by more subtle cognitive deficits which have substantial social and economic impact, effective preventative interventions would likely have more extensive benefits. The current study evaluates in primary care a multidomain risk-reduction intervention targeting adults with high risk of developing dementia.\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted to evaluate three intervention programmes using a pragmatic approach suitable to the clinic: (1) a 12-week online and face-to-face dementia risk-reduction intervention (Body Brain Life-General Practice (BBL-GP)); (2) a 6-week face-to-face group lifestyle modification programme (LMP); and (3) a 12-week email-only programme providing general health information. We aim to recruit 240 participants, aged 18 and over, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline and follow-ups (postintervention, 18, 36 and 62 weeks). The primary outcome is dementia risk measured with the modified version of the Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index Short Form. Secondary outcomes are cognitive function measured with Trails A and B, and the Digit Symbol Modalities Test; physical activity with moderate-vigorous physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; depression with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression; cost evaluation with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score and Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool; diet quality with the Australian Recommended Food Score; and sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThis RCT is a novel pragmatic intervention applied in a primary care setting to reduce the dementia risk exposure in adults at high risk. If successful, BBL-GP and LMP will provide a versatile, evidence-based package that can be easily and quickly rolled out to other primary care settings and which can be scaled up at relatively low cost compared with other strategies involving intensive interventions.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nACTRN12616000868482."}

Importance\nIdentifying modifiable risk factors that are associated with dementia burden across racial and ethnic groups in the population can yield insights into the potential effectiveness of interventions in preventing dementia and reducing disparities.\n\n\nObjective\nTo calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of dementia associated with 12 established modifiable risk factors for all US adults, as well as separately by race and ethnicity.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study used survey data from nationally representative samples of US adults. PAFs were calculated using relative risks and prevalence estimates for 12 risk factors. Relative risks were taken from meta-analyses, as reported in a 2020 systematic review. Prevalence estimates for risk factors were derived from nationally representative cross-sectional survey data collected between 2011 and 2018. Combined PAFs were adjusted for risk factor communality using weights derived from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (1987-2018). Analyses were conducted May through October 2021.\n\n\nExposures\nLow education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and air pollution.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPAF for each dementia risk factor, a combined PAF, and the decrease in the number of prevalent dementia cases in 2020 that would be expected given a 15% proportional decrease in each exposure.\n\n\nResults\nAmong all US adults, an estimated 41.0% (95% CI, 22.7%-55.9%) of dementia cases were attributable to 12 risk factors. A 15% proportional decrease in each risk factor would reduce dementia prevalence in the population by an estimated 7.3% (95% CI, 3.7%-10.9%). The estimated PAF was greater for Black and Hispanic than it was for White and Asian individuals. The greatest attributable fraction of dementia cases was observed for hypertension (PAF, 20.2%; 95% CI, 6.3%-34.4%), obesity (PAF, 20.9%; 95% CI, 13.0%-28.8%), and physical inactivity (PAF, 20.1%; 95% CI, 9.1%-29.6%). These factors were also highest within each racial and ethnic group, although the proportions varied.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nA large fraction of dementia cases in the US were associated with potentially modifiable risk factors, especially for Black and Hispanic individuals. Targeting and reducing these risk factors may curb the projected rise in dementia cases over the next several decades."}

PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nEvidence for the benefit of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease continues to accumulate. Many studies with individual vitamins or supplements show marginal, if any, benefit. However, new findings with combinatorial formulations demonstrate improvement in cognitive performance and behavioral difficulties that accompany Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we review some of the most recent clinical advances and summarize supportive preclinical studies.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nWe present novel positive effects on Alzheimer's disease derived from diet, trace elements, vitamins and supplements. We discuss the inherent difficulty in conducting nutritional studies because of the variance in participants' nutritional history, versus pharmacological interventions in which participants are naive to the intervention. We examine the evidence that epigenetics play a role in Alzheimer's disease and how nutritional intervention can modify the key epigenetic events to maintain or improve cognitive performance.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOverall consideration of the most recent collective evidence suggests that the optimal approach for Alzheimer's disease would seem to combine early, multicomponent nutritional approaches (a Mediterranean-style diet, multivitamins and key combinatorial supplements), along with lifestyle modifications such as social activity and mental and physical exercise, with ultimate addition of pharmacological agents when warranted."}

Data source WHI CaD Study, a seven year, randomised, placebo controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D (1g calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily) in 36,282 community dwelling postmenopausal women. Main outcome measures Incidence of four cardiovascular events and their combinations (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, death from coronary heart disease, and stroke) assessed with patient-level data and trial-level data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the WHI CaD Study there was an interaction between personal use of calcium supplements and allocated calcium and vitamin D for cardiovascular events. In the 16,718 women (46%) who were not taking personal calcium supplements at randomisation the hazard ratios for cardiovascular events with calcium and vitamin D ranged from 1.13 to 1.22 (P = 0.05 for clinical myocardial infarction or stroke, P = 0.04 for clinical myocardial infarction or revascularisation), whereas in the women taking personal calcium supplements cardiovascular risk did not alter with allocation to calcium and vitamin D. In meta-analyses of three placebo controlled trials, calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.44), P = 0.04), stroke (1.20 (1.00 to 1.43), P = 0.05), and the composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.16 (1.02 to 1.32), P = 0.02).

Forty-nine sedentary men [age: 73 ± 6 years (mean ± SD); body mass index: 28.5 ± 3.6 kg/m2] were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n = 25; 1500 mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30 g whey protein, 2.5 g creatine, 500 IU vitamin D, and 400 mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n = 24; 22 g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20 weeks consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-week resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON + EX). At baseline, 6 weeks, and 19 weeks we assessed cognitive function [Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)], memory [word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)], executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6 weeks: 23.5 ± 3.3 vs. 19 weeks: 24.4 ± 2.5, p = 0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT increased (6 weeks: 6.6 ± 3.6 vs. 19 weeks: 7.6 ± 3.8, p = 0.047); and reaction time improved (6 weeks: 567 ± 49 ms vs. 19 weeks: 551 ± 51 ms, p = 0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58 ± 0.62, p = 0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31 ± 0.61, p = 0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r = 0.49, p = 0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r = -0.44, p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability.

BACKGROUND\nThe role of cognitive reserve (CR) to explain individual differences in cognitive functioning is unclear in memory clinic patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the cross-sectional effect of CR on cognition in relation to levels of neurodegeneration in a large elderly single-center memory clinic population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, n = 481), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 628) or Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 1,099). Education was used as proxy for CR and visually rated medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on CT was used as parameter of neurodegeneration. Relations between CR, cognition, and MTA were analyzed with multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and cerebral atrophy. In addition, we examined if education affects the relation between MTA and cognition using an interaction variable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEducation was significantly related to all measures of cognition including subtests with an explained variance of education as a determinant of cognition of 11%. More highly educated patients had more advanced levels of MTA at the same level of cognition. All these results were stronger or only present in demented compared to non-demented patients but appeared no longer significant in those with lowest overall cognition. The interaction effect was significant indicating that with more advanced MTA, less cognitive decline was shown in higher educated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEducation is a very strong determinant of cognition in an elderly memory clinic population. The positive effect of education was stronger in demented than in non-demented patients but disappeared in those with the lowest cognitive scores indicating a \"window of CR benefit\"."}

Strong claims have been made about the efficacy of cognitive training. In particular, the idea that working memory (WM) training enhances intelligence initially generated enthusiasm but, on further inspection, is now met with skepticism. In our view, this is an unfortunate setback due to inappropriate task design and does not refute the core idea of cognitive enhancement. Growing evidence suggests that successful training programs integrate complexity, novelty, and diversity to maximize ecological validity."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether there are differences in age and sex distribution and presence of comorbidities between participants included in randomized controlled trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and nationwide cohort of persons with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original articles from their inception to January 4, 2015. Double-blind randomized controlled trials with donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine compared to placebo in participants with Alzheimer's disease were included. Data from a nationwide cohort of persons with clinically verified diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease was defined as a reference population.\n\n\nRESULTS\n128 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, 31 of them fulfilled criteria. Mean age of participants in randomized controlled trials (n = 15,032) was 5.8 years lower (95% CI 5.7 to 5.9, P < 0.001), compared to the mean age of 79.7 years in the reference population with Alzheimer's disease (n = 28,093). Most of the articles did not report age distribution of participants. The proportion of women was 63.2% (9,475/14,991) in randomized controlled trials and 67.8% (19,043/28,093) (P < 0.001) in the reference population. Information on comorbidities and use of concomitant drugs were lacking or poorly reported in most articles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a discrepancy between participants in randomized controlled trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and real-life population with Alzheimer's disease. Participants in randomized controlled trials were significantly younger. Further, more detailed reporting of age distribution, comorbidities and concomitant drugs would be important information for clinicians when evaluating conclusions from randomized controlled trials to real-life practice. The existing recommendations of inclusion of older people should be followed to ensure safe pharmacotherapy for older people."}

BACKGROUND\nThe Mediterranean diet has long been reported to be protective against the occurrence of several different health outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to update our previous meta-analysis of published cohort prospective studies that investigated the effects of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on health status.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search through electronic databases up to June 2010.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe updated review process showed 7 prospective studies published in the past 2 y that were not included in the previous meta-analysis (1 study for overall mortality, 3 studies for cardiovascular incidence or mortality, 1 study for cancer incidence or mortality, and 2 studies for neurodegenerative diseases). These recent studies included 2 health outcomes not previously investigated (ie, mild cognitive impairment and stroke). The meta-analysis for all studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94).

BACKGROUND\nThe proportion of European elderly is expected to increase to 30% in 2060. Combining dietary components may modulate many processes involved in ageing. So, it is likely that a healthful diet approach might have greater favourable impact on age-related decline than individual dietary components. This paper describes the design of a healthful diet intervention on inflammageing and its consequences in the elderly.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe NU-AGE study is a parallel randomized one-year trial in 1250 apparently healthy, independently living European participants aged 65-80 years. Participants are randomised into either the diet group or control group. Participants in the diet group received dietary advice aimed at meeting the nutritional requirements of the ageing population. Special attention was paid to nutrients that may be inadequate or limiting in diets of elderly, such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, and calcium. C-reactive protein is measured as primary outcome.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe NU-AGE study is the first dietary intervention investigating the effect of a healthful diet providing targeted nutritional recommendations for optimal health and quality of life in apparently healthy European elderly. Results of this intervention will provide evidence on the effect of a healthful diet on the prevention of age related decline."}

The median healthy life span of Cr-fed mice was 9% higher than in control mice, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests. In brains of Cr-treated mice, there was a trend towards a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the \"aging pigment\" lipofuscin.

Due to improved health care, diet and infrastructure in developed countries, since 1840 life expectancy has increased by approximately 2 years per decade. Accordingly, by 2050, a quarter of Europe's population will be over 65 years, representing a 10 % rise in half a century. With this rapid rise comes an increased prevalence of diseases of ageing and associated healthcare expenditure. To address the health consequences of global ageing, research in model systems (worms, flies and mice) has indicated that reducing the rate of organ growth, via reductions in protein synthetic rates, has multi-organ health benefits that collectively lead to improvements in lifespan. In contrast, human pre-clinical, clinical and large cohort prospective studies demonstrate that ageing leads to anabolic (i.e. growth) impairments in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to reductions in muscle mass and strength, factors directly associated with mortality rates in the elderly. As such, increasing muscle protein synthesis via exercise or protein-based nutrition maintains a strong, healthy muscle mass, which in turn leads to improved health, independence and functionality. The aim of this review is to critique current literature relating to the maintenance of muscle mass across lifespan and discuss whether maintaining or reducing protein synthesis is the most logical approach to support musculoskeletal function and by extension healthy human ageing."}

BACKGROUND/AIMS\nThe aim was to examine added benefits of a Comprehensive, Individualized, Person-Centered Management (CI-PCM) program to memantine treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a 28-week, clinician-blinded, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study, with a similar study population, similar eligibility criteria, and a similar design to the memantine pivotal trial of Reisberg et al. [N Engl J Med 2003;348:1333-1341]. Twenty eligible community-residing Alzheimer disease (AD) subject-caregiver dyads were randomized to the CI-PCM program (n = 10) or to usual community care (n = 10). Primary outcomes were the New York University Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (NYU-CIBIC-Plus), assessed by one clinician set, and an activities of daily living inventory, assessed by a separate clinician set at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 28.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrimary outcomes showed significant benefits of the CI-PCM program at all post-baseline evaluations. Improvement on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus in the management group at 28 weeks was 2.9 points over the comparator group. The memantine 2003 trial showed an improvement of 0.3 points on this global measure in memantine-treated versus placebo-randomized subjects at 28 weeks. Hence, globally, the management program intervention benefits were 967% greater than memantine treatment alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results are approximately 10 times those usually observed with both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments and indicate substantial benefits with the management program for advanced AD persons."}

BACKGROUND\nTo test a life course model linking circumstances of origin to self-reported literacy and numeracy problems in midlife, and to investigate the effects in this model of changing social circumstances in two post-war cohorts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBased on data from men and women in the British 1946 and 1958 birth cohorts, we used the relative index of inequality and logistical regression to test associations between father's occupation, childhood cognition, educational attainment, own occupation in the third decade, and a binary variable representing self-reported literacy and numeracy problems in the fourth decade.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a lower frequency of literacy and numeracy problems in the 1958 cohort than in the 1946 cohort. In both cohorts there were associations between father's occupation and childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation, a pattern that was mirrored by the associations between childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation to adult literacy and numeracy problems. Positive associations between childhood cognition and educational attainment, and between educational attainment and own occupation, were stronger in the 1946 cohort than in the 1958 cohort. However, inverse associations between educational attainment and literacy and numeracy problems were stronger in the 1958 cohort, possibly reflecting the expansion of secondary education in the intervening years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiteracy and numeracy problems have a robust structure of life course associations, although the changing pattern of these associations may reflect important social structural changes from the early post-war years to the early 1960s in the UK."}

In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to the development of statistical methods for the analysis of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis, with a focus on situations in which the analyst has patient-level data on the costs and health effects of alternative interventions. To date, discussions have focused almost exclusively on addressing the practical challenges involved in estimating confidence intervals for CE ratios. However, the general approach of using confidence intervals to convey information about uncertainty around CE ratio estimates suffers from theoretical limitations that render it inappropriate in many situations. The authors present an alternative framework for analyzing uncertainty in the economic evaluation of health interventions (the \"net health benefits\" approach) that is more broadly applicable and that avoids some problems of prior methods. This approach offers several practical and theoretical advantages over the analysis of CE ratios, is straightforward to apply, and highlights some important principles in the theoretical underpinnings of CE analysis."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo compare the relative efficacy of visual versus auditory cueing on gait among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nA systematic search was completed up to September 2011, using the following databases: EMBASE, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, and PubMed.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nFour authors searched the databases using the following terms: Parkinson's disease (including abbreviations), gait, cadence, step, pace, cueing, cues, and prompt. All studies that evaluated the effect of cueing on gait in PD were selected by consensus of 2 pairs of authors who reviewed the titles and abstracts. Each pair of authors then applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to each study, and 25 articles were chosen. Inclusion criteria were cueing studies that reported pre- and postoutcome measures of gait parameters. Exclusion criteria were lack of data and studies that evaluated gait aids.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nGait measures of cadence, stride length, and velocity, before and after cueing, were collected from each study. If data were represented in graphs, a pair of authors extracted the data points individually, then compared and averaged values.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nThe data were synthesized using a meta-analysis based on cue type. Auditory cueing demonstrated significant improvement of cadence (Hedge g=.556; 95% confidence interval [CI], .291-.893), stride length (Hedge g=.497; 95% CI, .289-.696), and velocity (Hedge g=.544; 95% CI, .294-.795). In contrast, visual cueing significantly improved stride length only (Hedge g=.554; 95% CI, .072-1.036).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that auditory cueing is more effective for treating gait disorders in PD. Further research is needed to determine the optimum auditory cueing strategy for gait improvements."}

BACKGROUND\nImproving cardiovascular health possibly decreases the risk of dementia. Primary care practices offer a suitable setting for monitoring and controlling cardiovascular risk factors in the older population. The purpose of the study is to examine the association of a cardiovascular health metric including six behaviors and blood parameters with the risk of dementia in primary care patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants (N = 3547) were insurants aged ≥55 of the largest German statutory health insurance company, who were enrolled in a six-year prospective population-based study. Smoking, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose were assessed by general practitioners at routine examinations. Using recommended cut-offs for each factor, the patients' cardiovascular health was classified as ideal, moderate, or poor. Behaviors and blood parameters sub-scores, as well as a total score, were calculated. Dementia diagnoses were retrieved from health insurance claims data. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the course of the study 296 new cases of dementia occurred. Adjusted for age, sex, and education, current smoking (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.09-2.85), moderate (1.38, 1.05-1.81) or poor (1.81, 1.32-2.47) levels of physical activity, and poor fasting glucose levels (1.43, 1.02-2.02) were associated with an increased risk of dementia. Body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol were not associated with dementia. Separate summary scores for behaviors and blood values, as well as a total score showed no association with dementia. Sensitivity analyses with differently defined endpoints led to similar results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDue to complex relationships of body-mass index and blood pressure with dementia individual components cancelled each other out and rendered the sum-scores meaningless for the prediction of dementia."}

Cases were evaluated at the individual level within the context of 31 communities (one center encompassed two separate geographical regions). Multivariate analysis was used to determine the significance of individual variables on medication use. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks were less likely to use AChEI and memantine with odds ratios (OR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76) and 0.43 (95% CI 0.32-0.57), respectively.

After nearly a century of rigorous investigation and testing, dietary caloric restriction (CR) remains the most robust and reproducible method for slowing aging and maintaining health, function, and vitality.

To overcome these issues, we initiated the field of CR mimetics in 1998 and have observed its development into a full-fledged antiaging industry. Basically, strategies that enable individuals to obtain the biological benefits of CR without reducing actual food intake can be considered CR mimetics, whether functional, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, or other. Some of the best known candidates include resveratrol and related agents, the antidiabetic drug metformin, and rapamycin and other mTOR regulators. While the mechanisms of action vary, these and essentially all CR mimetic candidates work through at least some of the same pathways as actual CR. While the entire field continues to evolve rapidly, the current status will be reviewed here, with particular focus on recent developments, the most practical relevance and applicability for potential consumers, and new strategies for the future."}

We describe a novel process for transforming the efficiency of partial expected value of sample information (EVSI) computation in decision models. Traditional EVSI computation begins with Monte Carlo sampling to produce new simulated data-sets with a specified sample size. Each data-set is synthesised with prior information to give posterior distributions for model parameters, either via analytic formulae or a further Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A further 'inner level' Monte Carlo sampling then quantifies the effect of the simulated data on the decision. This paper describes a novel form of Bayesian Laplace approximation, which can be replace both the Bayesian updating and the inner Monte Carlo sampling to compute the posterior expectation of a function. We compare the accuracy of EVSI estimates in two case study cost-effectiveness models using 1st and 2nd order versions of our approximation formula, the approximation of Tierney and Kadane, and traditional Monte Carlo. Computational efficiency gains depend on the complexity of the net benefit functions, the number of inner level Monte Carlo samples used, and the requirement or otherwise for MCMC methods to produce the posterior distributions. This methodology provides a new and valuable approach for EVSI computation in health economic decision models and potential wider benefits in many fields requiring Bayesian approximation."}

BACKGROUND\nDespite the projected increase in dementia cases affecting various ethnic groups worldwide, representation of these ethnic groups in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments to improve cognitive function in persons with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is unclear. We aimed to quantify the inclusion of various ethnicities in dementia treatment RCTs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRCTs published between January 1, 2000 and August 1, 2017 (inclusive) were included. Participants were community-dwelling adults with a diagnosis of either dementia or MCI randomized to receive either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive function. Analyses were performed to determine study-level characteristics associated with recruitment of various ethnic groups. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine the pooled prevalence for each ethnicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 96 RCTs consisting of 37,278 participants (57.2% female) were included in the final analysis. Only 39 (39.4%) trials reported the ethnicity of included participants. The pooled proportion of non-Caucasian trial participants was 11.4% (95% CI, 7.5 to 15.9%).

This study examined the longitudinal associations of CRF with brain atrophy and cognitive decline in a late-middle-aged cohort of adults at risk for AD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred ten cognitively unimpaired adults (66% female, mean age at baseline 64.2 ± 5.7 years) completed a baseline graded treadmill exercise test, two brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (over 4.67 ± 1.17 years), and two to three cognitive assessments (over 3.26 ± 1.02 years). Linear mixed effects models examined the longitudinal associations adjusted for covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants with higher baseline CRF had slower annual decline in total gray matter volume (P = .013) and cognitive function (P = .048), but not hippocampal volume (P = .426). Exploratory analyses suggested these effects may be stronger among apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nCRF is a modifiable physiological attribute that may be targeted during the preclinical phase of AD in effort to delay disease progression, perhaps most effectively among those with genetic risk."}

Higher Present Time Orientation was significantly related to perceptions of having little control over risks to health (P=0.004), God's Will in determining AD (P=0.001), and lower AD knowledge (P<0.0001) and marginally related to having little control over developing AD (P=0.052).

We found that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans with lower star ratings had significantly higher rates of disenrollment by incident dialysis patients in the following year. Compared to MA plans with 4.0 or more stars, adjusted disenrollment rates were 3.9 percentage points higher for plans with 3.5 stars, 5.0 percentage points higher for those with 3.0 stars, and 12.1 percentage points higher for those with 2.5 or fewer stars.

BACKGROUND\nStudies examining whether genetic risk information about common, complex diseases can motivate individuals to improve health behaviors and advance planning have shown mixed results. Examining the influence of different study recruitment strategies may help reconcile inconsistencies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSecondary analyses were conducted on data from the REVEAL study, a series of randomized clinical trials examining the impact of genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested whether self-referred participants (SRPs) were more likely than actively recruited participants (ARPs) to report health behavior and advance planning changes after AD risk and APOE genotype disclosure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 795 participants with known recruitment status, 546 (69%) were self-referred and 249 (31%) had been actively recruited. SRPs were younger, less likely to identify as African American, had higher household incomes, and were more attentive to AD than ARPs (all P < 0.01). They also dropped out of the study before genetic risk disclosure less frequently (26% versus 41%, P < 0.001). Cohorts did not differ in their likelihood of reporting a change to at least one health behavior 6 weeks and 12 months after genetic risk disclosure, nor in intentions to change at least one behavior in the future. However, interaction effects were observed where ε4-positive SRPs were more likely than ε4-negative SRPs to report changes specifically to mental activities (38% vs 19%, p < 0.001) and diets (21% vs 12%, p = 0.016) six weeks post-disclosure, whereas differences between ε4-positive and ε4-negative ARPs were not evident for mental activities (15% vs 21%, p = 0.413) or diets (8% versus 16%, P = 0.190). Similarly, ε4-positive participants were more likely than ε4-negative participants to report intentions to change long-term care insurance among SRPs (20% vs 5%, p < 0.001), but not ARPs (5% versus 9%, P = 0.365).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIndividuals who proactively seek AD genetic risk assessment are more likely to undergo testing and use results to inform behavior changes than those who respond to genetic testing offers. These results demonstrate how the behavioral impact of genetic risk information may vary according to the models by which services are provided, and suggest that how participants are recruited into translational genomics research can influence findings.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00089882 and NCT00462917."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the association between caffeine intake, cognitive decline, and incident dementia in a community-based sample of subjects aged 65 years and over.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were 4,197 women and 2,820 men from a population-based cohort recruited from three French cities. Cognitive performance, clinical diagnosis of dementia, and caffeine consumption were evaluated at baseline and at 2 and 4 year follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCaffeine consumption is associated with a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables which may also affect cognitive decline. Multivariate mixed models and multivariate adjusted logistic regression indicated that women with high rates of caffeine consumption (over three cups per day) showed less decline in verbal retrieval (OR = 0.67, CI = 0.53, 0.85), and to a lesser extent in visuospatial memory (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.65, 1.03) over 4 years than women consuming one cup or less.

No relation was found between caffeine intake and cognitive decline in men. Caffeine consumption did not reduce dementia risk over 4 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe psychostimulant properties of caffeine appear to reduce cognitive decline in women without dementia, especially at higher ages.

Many types of registries (population-based cancer, quality improvement, disease-specific, web-based disease-neutral registries, local general practice registers, and national health database) are used to recruit subjects for clinical trials and uncover new knowledge. Overall, 16 registries are in the US, 4 in UK, 1 each in Canada, Spain, and Australia and 1 involved in many countries. Registries can identify very large number of subjects for screening for eligibility for clinical trials, especially in very large trials, rare disease trials, and trials involving minority patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegistries can retrospectively identify very large numbers of potential subjects for screening for eligibility and enrollment in prospective clinical trials.

BACKGROUND\nAge is the cardinal risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are more prevalent with increasing age, may contribute to AD. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been shown to be associated with cognitive health and decreased burden of AD-related brain alterations in older adults. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine whether CRF attenuates age-related accumulation of WMH in middle-aged adults at risk for AD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred and seven cognitively unimpaired, late-middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and performed graded maximal treadmill exercise testing from which we calculated the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) as our measure of CRF. Total WMH were quantified using the Lesion Segmentation Tool and scaled to intracranial volume. Linear regression adjusted for APOE4 carriage, family history, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and sex was used to examine relationships between age, WMH, and CRF.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs expected, there was a significant association between age and WMH (p < .001). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between age and OUES on WMH (p = .015). Simple main effects analyses revealed that the effect of age on WMH remained significant in the Low OUES group (p < .001) but not in the High OUES group (p = .540), indicating that higher CRF attenuates the deleterious age association with WMH.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher CRF tempers the adverse effect of age on WMH. This suggests a potential pathway through which increased aerobic fitness facilitates healthy brain aging, especially among individuals at risk for AD."}

However, the consumer-centered approach yielded better retention of older minorities (chi(2) = 6.20, p <.05) than did the traditional method. Within both methods, recruitment through provider referral and face-to-face contact were the superior recruitment methods (chi(2) = 6.78, p <.05).

The number of SIRT1-immunoreactive cells in the CR group was significantly higher than in the NC and HE groups, and SIRT1 mRNA expression in the CR group was significantly higher than that in the HE group, but there was no difference in SIRT1 protein expression among the three groups. mTOR and S6K1 protein activation and mTOR and S6K1 mRNA were significantly lower in the CR group than in the NC group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that a CR diet could lead to activation of SIRT1 and suppression of mTOR and S6K1 activation in C57BL/6 mice. We have shown that the SIRT1/mTOR signaling pathways may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of CR."}

A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Natural flavonoids are promising agents for inflammation-related tumor progression in patients with CRC. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of flavonoid fisetin supplementation on the inflammatory status and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in these patients. In this double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, 37 CRC patients undergoing chemotherapy were assigned to receive either 100 mg fisetin (n = 18) or placebo (n = 19) for seven consecutive weeks. The supplementation began one week before chemotherapy and continued until the end of the second chemotherapy cycle. Levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), MMP-7, and MMP-9 were measured in plasma using ELISA, before and after the intervention. The trial was registered at http://www.irct.ir (code: IRCT2015110511288N9). The participants were 55.59 ± 15.46 years old with 62.16% being male. After the intervention, the plasma levels of IL-8 and hs-CRP reduced significantly in the fisetin group (p < 0.04 and p < 0.01, respectively). Additionally, fisetin supplementation suppressed the values of MMP-7 levels (p < 0.02). However, significant changes were observed only in IL-8 concentrations in the fisetin group when compared with the placebo group (p < 0.03). The changes in the levels of other metabolic factors were not statistically significant. According to the results, fisetin could improve the inflammatory status in CRC patients, suggesting it as a novel complementary antitumor agent for these patients and warranting further studies."}

Much has been achieved by recent research to increase understanding of the links between nutrition and muscle health. Focusing on muscle strength as the key component of sarcopenia, the aim of this overview was to evaluate its links to nutrition, both to variation in habitual diets in older populations, as well as considering supplementation effects in trials. A main message from the reviewed studies is that while many provide suggestive evidence of benefits of higher nutrient intakes and diets of higher quality, findings are inconsistent, and data on muscle strength are often lacking. To assess the potential of optimising diets as a strategy to promote and maintain muscle strength, gaps in current evidence need to be addressed. These include the need for (i) better understanding of individual differences in responsiveness to dietary change, and the need for targeted nutritional support; (ii) clearer distinction between protective and therapeutic actions of diet; and (iii) definition of the role of dietary patterns and their influence on muscle strength, to allow effects of changes in food consumption to be evaluated-particularly when combined with physical activity. Development of this evidence is needed to enable translation into appropriate dietary recommendations for older populations."}

INTRODUCTION\nCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been shown to be related to brain health in older adults. In individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), CRF may be a modifiable risk factor that could attenuate anticipated declines in brain volume and episodic memory. The objective of this study was to determine the association between CRF and both hippocampal volume and episodic memory in a cohort of cognitively healthy older adults with familial and/or genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty-six enrollees from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention participated in this study. Participants performed a graded maximal exercise test, underwent a T-1 anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scan, and completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant relationships between CRF and HV or RAVLT memory scores for the entire sample. When the sample was explored on the basis of gender, CRF was significantly associated with hippocampal volume for women. For men, significant positive associations were observed between CRF and RAVLT memory scores.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThese results suggest that CRF may be protective against both hippocampal volume and episodic memory decline in older adults at risk for AD, but that the relationships may be gender specific."}

PURPOSE\nTo examine the effect of antihypertensive adherence on blood pressure and barriers to adherence in racially diverse elderly patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTelephone survey of a representative sample of 300 of all 3416 hypertensive patients aged >70 from four urban primary care practices. From electronic records, we calculated subjects' annual mean systolic blood pressure. We asked about the last missed antihypertensive dose in six time intervals. Based on association with blood pressure control, non-adherence was defined as missing any dose in the past 3 months. Subjects were also asked about six domains of adherence barriers: health, personal support, drug coverage, medication filling and use, doctor-patient interaction and knowledge. All models adjust for demographics, treatment regimen and sampling weights.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 202 subjects (67% response rate) were: female (65.9%), black (64.8%), mean age 77.4 years (5.49) and on mean 2.4 (SD 1.3) antihypertensive drugs. Mean annual systolic pressure for non-adherent subjects (22% of the cohort) was higher than adherent subjects (137.7 vs.133.4 mmHg, p = 0.065). After adjustment, the association between adherence and blood pressure was stronger in black than white patients (p = 0.007). In an initial model, being unaware of Medicare Part D had a lower adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of adherence (p < 0.05). In the final model, adherence barriers were: medication filling/use (run out of pills [AOR 0.25, CI 0.09-0.66] and 28% reduction per each of eight barriers); doctor-patient interaction (less important to discuss hypertension [AOR 0.32, CI 0.12-0.84]); and knowledge (38% lower AOR per incorrect answer about diseases unrelated to hypertension).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSelf-reported adherence was associated with a higher blood pressure, especially in elderly black patients. To promote adherence, our data suggest targeting: filling prescriptions, prioritizing hypertension care and educating about effects of hypertension."}

BACKGROUND\nDespite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few Australian childcare services provide food that is consistent with dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the intervention using data collected within the trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12 months. Costs (reported in $AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service. The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative value index was calculated to determine overall value for money.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the 12 months of the trial, we calculated a difference in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of - $482 (95% UI - $859, - $56). While the measured increase in menu and food group compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance, there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes generated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCompared to usual practice, web-based programmes may offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616000974404."}

E. (2002). Facing the future: City of Detroit needs assessment). Detroit, MI: Wayne State University.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nA community-based participatory research approach was used to establish the HBE as an educational and support program in Detroit and to use HBE to launch a research participant registry of older Black adults. Data were drawn from a community-based telephone survey of 723 older African American elders aged 60 years and older recruited into the PRP registry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPRP participants had some differences from those in the Detroit Health Needs Assessment. These included that older women had a significantly higher participatory rate compared with their male counterparts. African American women in the PRP reported a modestly healthier life with less disability compared with their Detroit Health Needs Assessment counterparts, whereas for men, it was the reverse for chronic diseases. The PRP was able to attract a significantly higher percentage of older old compared with the population = based survey.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nStudy findings suggest that the HBE approach of recruiting African American elders in health research appears effective and to have some unique strengths."}

PURPOSE\nCreatine supplementation has been shown to enhance muscle strength and power after only 5-7 d in young adults. Creatine supplementation could therefore benefit older individuals because aging is associated with a decrease in muscle strength and explosive power.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examined the effects of 7 d of creatine supplementation in normally active older men (59-72 yr) by using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design with repeated measures. After a 3-wk familiarization period to minimize learning effects, a battery of tests was completed on three occasions separated by 7 d (T1, T2, and T3). After T1, subjects were matched and randomly assigned into creatine (N = 10) and placebo (N = 8) groups. After T2, subjects consumed supplements (0.3 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 7 d until T3. All subjects were tested for maximal dynamic strength (one-repetition maximum leg press and bench press), maximal isometric strength (knee extension/flexion), upper- and lower-body explosive power (6 x 10-s sprints on a cycle ergometer), and lower-extremity functional ability (timed sit-stand test and tandem gait test). Body composition was assessed via hydrostatic weighing, and blood samples were obtained to assess renal and hepatic responses and muscle creatine concentrations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant increases in any performance measures were observed from T1 to T2 with the exception of isometric right-knee flexion in the placebo group indicating stability in the testing protocols. Significant group-by -time interactions indicated the responses from T2 to T3 were significantly greater (P <or= 0.05) in the creatine compared with the placebo group, respectively, for body mass (1.86 and -1.01 kg), fat-free mass (2.22 and 0.00 kg), maximal dynamic strength (7-8 and 1-2%), maximal isometric strength (9-15 and -6 to 1%), lower-body mean power (11 and 0%), and lower-extremity functional capacity (6-9 and 1-2%). No adverse side effects were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data indicate that 7 d of creatine supplementation is effective at increasing several indices of muscle performance, including functional tests in older men without adverse side effects. Creatine supplementation may be a useful therapeutic strategy for older adults to attenuate loss in muscle strength and performance of functional living tasks."}

Tests were conducted pre-supplementation and following 10 and 30 days of supplementation. Leg fatigue was determined using an isokinetic dynamometer; subjects performed 5 sets of 30 maximal voluntary contractions at 180 degrees x s(-1), with 1 min of recovery between sets. The strength of the elbow flexors was assessed using a modified preacher bench attached to a strain gauge. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05; group x time) in leg fatigue following supplementation. However, this interaction appears to have resulted from a combination of the improved fatigue score by the Cr-supplemented group and the decreased fatigue score by the P-supplemented group, because when the simple main effects were analyzed for the groups individually, there was no significant difference over time for either of the groups. There were no significant differences in body mass, body density, or fat-free mass as assessed by hydrostatic weighing, or strength between the Cr-supplemented or P-supplemented groups. These data suggest that 30 days of Cr-supplementation may have a beneficial effect on reducing muscle fatigue in men over the age of 60 years, but it does not affect body composition or strength."}

Impairment or interruption of oxygen supply compromises brain function and plays a role in neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound involved in the buffering, transport, and regulation of cellular energy, with the potential to replenish cellular adenosine triphosphate without oxygen. Creatine is also neuroprotective in vitro against anoxic/hypoxic damage. Dietary creatine supplementation has been associated with improved symptoms in neurological disorders defined by impaired neural energy provision. Here we investigate, for the first time in humans, the utility of creatine as a dietary supplement to protect against energetic insult. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of oral creatine supplementation on the neurophysiological and neuropsychological function of healthy young adults during acute oxygen deprivation. Fifteen healthy adults were supplemented with creatine and placebo treatments for 7 d, which increased brain creatine on average by 9.2%. A hypoxic gas mixture (10% oxygen) was administered for 90 min, causing global oxygen deficit and impairing a range of neuropsychological processes. Hypoxia-induced decrements in cognitive performance, specifically attentional capacity, were restored when participants were creatine supplemented, and corticomotor excitability increased. A neuromodulatory effect of creatine via increased energy availability is presumed to be a contributing factor of the restoration, perhaps by supporting the maintenance of appropriate neuronal membrane potentials. Dietary creatine monohydrate supplementation augments neural creatine, increases corticomotor excitability, and prevents the decline in attention that occurs during severe oxygen deficit. This is the first demonstration of creatine's utility as a neuroprotective supplement when cellular energy provision is compromised."}

BACKGROUND\nAmong the large number of cohort studies that employ propensity score matching, most match patients 1:1. Increasing the matching ratio is thought to improve precision but may come with a trade-off with respect to bias.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate several methods of propensity score matching in cohort studies through simulation and empirical analyses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe simulated cohorts of 20,000 patients with exposure prevalence of 10%-50%. We simulated five dichotomous and five continuous confounders. We estimated propensity scores and matched using digit-based greedy (\"greedy\"), pairwise nearest neighbor within a caliper (\"nearest neighbor\"), and a nearest neighbor approach that sought to balance the scores of the comparison patient above and below that of the treated patient (\"balanced nearest neighbor\"). We matched at both fixed and variable matching ratios and also evaluated sequential and parallel schemes for the order of formation of 1:n match groups. We then applied this same approach to two cohorts of patients drawn from administrative claims data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 generally resulted in somewhat higher bias. It also resulted in lower variance with variable ratio matching but higher variance with fixed. The parallel approach generally resulted in higher mean squared error but lower bias than the sequential approach. Variable ratio, parallel, balanced nearest neighbor matching generally yielded the lowest bias and mean squared error.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n1:n matching can be used to increase precision in cohort studies. We recommend a variable ratio, parallel, balanced 1:n, nearest neighbor approach that increases precision over 1:1 matching at a small cost in bias."}

BACKGROUND\nEarly screenings involving biomarkers and use of potential disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may have significant humanistic implications for treatment strategies in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMarkov models simulated transitions of patient cohorts beginning in predementia, a hypothetical early stage of Alzheimer's disease marked by objective cognitive impairment/memory complaints without functional impairment, and followed for 10 years. Hypothetical cohorts of 10,000 patients included those who were treated with standard of care (donepezil) upon reaching mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease, a DMT in predementia, and a DMT in mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Transition probabilities were based on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and published clinical data, and estimated for the hypothetical DMT. In each disease stage (predementia, mild, moderate, or severe), time was computed and costs were estimated using literature review and published data, and published data provided mortality rates. The impact of screening was evaluated using positive predictive value (patients identified as predementia truly at risk for transition to dementia).\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarlier treatment yielded modest gains in total life-years; however, the distribution was skewed towards milder disease. Assuming a 25% reduction in the annual risk of progression, treating predementia patients with DMT increased life-years in predementia to mild states on average from 3.2 to 4.2, while life-years spent in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease decreased from 2.6 to 2.2. Average time in the community increased from 4.4 to 5.4 years, while time in long-term care declined from 1.3 to 0.9 years. This impact grows as the advantage of the novel agent increases. Screening accuracy had significant implications for cost-effectiveness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf screening can accurately identify predementia patients at risk for progression, earlier treatment with DMTs has the potential benefit to patients of prolonging time in milder disease, reducing time spent with more severe disease, increasing time in the community, and reducing time in long-term care."}

The study group comprised 70 healthy postmenopausal women, aged 47-65 years, with previous hysterectomy. Sixty-two women completed the study. Cognitive speed and accuracy, attention, and memory were evaluated. Serum estradiol (E2) and FSH levels were controlled at the end of the estrogen, placebo, and wash-out periods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost of the cognitive tests correlated with age: older women were slower and made more errors than younger women. Estrogen replacement therapy was not superior to the placebo in any test of cognitive performance. In two out of ten visual detection tasks, recognition thresholds were longer with estrogen than with the placebo (P < .001 and P = .004). On the most demanding test of working memory, the reaction times (P = .045) and error rates (P = .043) differed between treatments, yet this finding proved to be an effect of learning rather than treatment.

OBJECTIVES\nto assess the cardioprotective properties of a blueberry enriched diet (BD).\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in ischemia-related myocardial injury. The attempts to use synthetic antioxidants to block the detrimental effects of ROS have produced mixed or negative results precipitating the interest in natural products. Blueberries are readily available product with the highest antioxidant capacity among fruits and vegetables.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nFollowing 3-mo of BD or a regular control diet (CD), the threshold for mitochondrial permeability transition (t(MPT)) was measured in isolated cardiomyocytes obtained from young male Fischer-344 rats. Compared to CD, BD resulted in a 24% increase (p<0.001) of ROS indexed t(MPT). The remaining animals were subjected to a permanent ligation of the left descending coronary artery. 24 hrs later resulting myocardial infarction (MI) in rats on BD was 22% less than in CD rats (p<0.01). Significantly less TUNEL(+) cardiomyocytes (2% vs 9%) and 40% less inflammation cells were observed in the myocardial area at risk of BD compared to CD rats (p<0.01). In the subgroup of rats, after coronary ligation the original diet was either continued or switched to the opposite one, and cardiac remodeling and MI expansion were followed by serial echocardiography for 10 weeks. Measurements suggested that continuation of BD or its withdrawal after MI attenuated or accelerated rates of post MI cardiac remodeling and MI expansion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA blueberry-enriched diet protected the myocardium from induced ischemic damage and demonstrated the potential to attenuate the development of post MI chronic heart failure."}

OBJECTIVES\nTo provide information on the advantages and possible disadvantages of using canes and walkers.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nEnglish-language articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-May 2003) for key words cane or walker , excluding articles unrelated to mobility aids. Bibliographies were reviewed and ISI Web of Science citation searches were run to identify additional references. Over 1000 articles were selected for further evaluation.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nWe extracted all studies of single-tip canes or pickup walkers addressing: (1) functional, biomechanic, or neuromotor benefits; (2) biomechanic, attentional, neuromotor, metabolic, or physiologic demands; and (3) falls, injuries, or other problems. We included approximately 10% of the articles originally identified.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nThe methodology of each selected article, and findings relevant to the benefits, demands, or adverse effects of cane or walker use were summarized.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nFindings were synthesized by considering their relation to basic biomechanic principles. Some biomechanic findings appear to support the clinical view that canes and walkers can improve balance and mobility for older adults and people with other clinical conditions. However, a large proportion of users experience difficulties, and the use of such devices is associated with increased risk of falling. A small number of studies have characterized some of the specific demands and problems associated with using mobility aids.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinical and biomechanic evaluations of canes and walkers confirm that these devices can improve balance and mobility. However, they can also interfere with ones ability to maintain balance in certain situations, and the strength and metabolic demands can be excessive. More research is needed to identify and solve specific problems. Such research may lead to improved designs and guidelines for safer use of canes and walkers."}

Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., 'borrowing') this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of 'dynamic' (versus 'static') borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners."}

PURPOSE\nTo examine the contribution of \"values-based reasoning\" in evaluating older adults' capacity to make medical decisions.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nOlder men with schizophrenia (n=20) or dementia (n=20), and a primary care comparison group (n=19), completed cognitive and psychiatric screening and an interview to determine their capacity to make medical decisions, which included a component on values. All of the participants were receiving treatment at Veterans Administration (VA) outpatient clinics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants varied widely in the activities and relationships they most valued, the extent to which religious beliefs would influence healthcare decisions, and in ratings of the importance of preserving quality versus length of life. Most participants preferred shared decision making with doctor, family, or both. Individuals with schizophrenia or dementia performed worse than a primary care comparison group in reasoning measured by the ability to list risks and benefits and compare choices. Individuals with dementia performed comparably to the primary care group in reasoning measured by the ability to justify choices in terms of valued abilities or activities, whereas individuals with schizophrenia performed relatively worse compared to the other two groups. Compared to primary care patients, participants with schizophrenia and with dementia were impaired on the ability to explain treatment choices in terms of valued relationships.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMedical decision making may be influenced by strongly held values and beliefs, emotions, and long life experience. To date, these issues have not been explicitly included in structured evaluations of medical decision-making capacity. This study demonstrated that it is possible to inquire of and elicit a range of healthcare related values and preferences from older adults with dementia or schizophrenia, and individuals with mild to moderate dementia may be able to discuss healthcare options in relation to their values.

Most cost-effectiveness studies using simulation modeling have demonstrated that donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are cost effective for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). These conclusions are in large part based on the assumption that improvement in cognitive status, or prevention of cognitive and functional decline, reduces the amount of time patients spend institutionalized or receiving other full-time care. However, as discussed in this article, outcomes besides delay to institutionalization affect the costs of AD. In reviews of utilization data from Medicare and managed care organizations, it was noted that hospitalization and post acute care in skilled nursing facilities accounted for the largest amount of excess direct costs, even among patients with mild or moderate AD. These utilization reviews also suggest that many patients with AD and related dementias require inpatient care because they are not able to self-manage comorbid conditions. The improvements in cognitive status and daily functioning associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy are expected to translate into improved management of comorbidities and reduced caregiver burden, thus reducing the total cost of care. To confirm these and other economic benefits of AChEIs, pharmacoeconomic outcomes should be evaluated routinely as part of randomized, controlled trials and through well-controlled observational studies of AD patients in community and institutional settings."}

The rate of cognitive decline after hospitalization was not related to the level of cognitive function at study entry (r = 0.01, p = 0.88) but was moderately correlated with rate of cognitive decline before hospitalization (r = 0.55, p = 0.021). More severe illness, longer hospital stay, and older age were each associated with faster cognitive decline after hospitalization but did not eliminate the effect of hospitalization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn old age, cognitive functioning tends to decline substantially after hospitalization even after controlling for illness severity and prehospital cognitive decline."}

OBJECTIVES\nTo test the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) influence predisposition to and the clinical course of Alzheimer disease (AD), the authors compared Choctaw Indians, a group with known high CRF with white persons with AD. In addition to CRF history, the authors investigated the frequency of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype andplasma homocysteine (HC) levels.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors compared 39 Choctaw Indians with AD and 39 Choctaw Indians without AD to 39 white persons with AD with all groups similar in age. CRF history included diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or hypolipidemic agent use, or myocardial infarction. The authors also compared plasma HC concentration and apoE4 allele frequency.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChoctaw persons with AD differed significantly from white persons with AD in history of hypertension, diabetes, and in HC values but not from Indians without AD. There was a significantly lower apoE4 allele frequency in Choctaw Indian AD than white persons with AD, and both AD groups had an affected first degree relative significantly more often than Indian controls. There was no relationship between the number of CRF and age at onset among Indians or whites, whereas HC concentration was associated with significantly earlier age of onset for Choctaw Indians but not for whites.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis small study suggests that in Choctaw Indians modifiable risk factors may play more of a role in disease pathogenesis than in whites and that nonmodifiable risk factors such as apoE4 may play less of a role."}

Importance\nRecent studies have yielded conflicting results as to whether testosterone treatment increases cardiovascular risk.\n\n\nObjective\nTo test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone slows progression of noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nDouble-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at 9 academic medical centers in the United States. The participants were 170 of 788 men aged 65 years or older with an average of 2 serum testosterone levels lower than 275 ng/dL (82 men assigned to placebo, 88 to testosterone) and symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism who were enrolled in the Testosterone Trials between June 24, 2010, and June 9, 2014.\n\n\nIntervention\nTestosterone gel, with the dose adjusted to maintain the testosterone level in the normal range for young men, or placebo gel for 12 months.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume, as determined by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Secondary outcomes included total coronary artery plaque volume and coronary artery calcium score (range of 0 to >400 Agatston units, with higher values indicating more severe atherosclerosis).\n\n\nResults\nOf 170 men who were enrolled, 138 (73 receiving testosterone treatment and 65 receiving placebo) completed the study and were available for the primary analysis. Among the 138 men, the mean (SD) age was 71.2 (5.7) years, and 81% were white. At baseline, 70 men (50.7%) had a coronary artery calcification score higher than 300 Agatston units, reflecting severe atherosclerosis. For the primary outcome, testosterone treatment compared with placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in noncalcified plaque volume from baseline to 12 months (from median values of 204 mm3 to 232 mm3 vs 317 mm3 to 325 mm3, respectively; estimated difference, 41 mm3; 95% CI, 14 to 67 mm3; P = .003). For the secondary outcomes, the median total plaque volume increased from baseline to 12 months from 272 mm3 to 318 mm3 in the testosterone group vs from 499 mm3 to 541 mm3 in the placebo group (estimated difference, 47 mm3; 95% CI, 13 to 80 mm3; P = .006), and the median coronary artery calcification score changed from 255 to 244 Agatston units in the testosterone group vs 494 to 503 Agatston units in the placebo group (estimated difference, -27 Agatston units; 95% CI, -80 to 26 Agatston units). No major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in either group.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAmong older men with symptomatic hypogonadism, treatment with testosterone gel for 1 year compared with placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified plaque volume, as measured by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Larger studies are needed to understand the clinical implications of this finding.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00799617."}

Over the past 50 years, the percentage of the elderly population has increased fourfold from 5.7% in 1960 to 23.1% in 2010. This change has occurred at the fastest rate in the world. Compared with France, where the percentage of the elderly population has increased just twofold in the past 100 years, Japanese society is aging at an unprecedented rate. In addition, the percentage of the very elderly (aged 75 years and over), comprising more frail people, exceeded 10% of the nation's population in 2008. In such a situation, many elderly Japanese wish to spend their later years healthy, and wish to achieve great accomplishments in their lives. To achieve that, rather than considering an aging population as a negative social phenomenon, we should create a society where elderly people can enjoy a healthy, prosperous life through social participation and contribution. Factors that hamper the elderly from leading a healthy life include various psychological and social problems occurring in older age, as well as a high incidence of diseases. Therefore, gerontology, which focuses on health promotion of the elderly by encompassing the study of social welfare, psychology, environment and social systems; and geriatrics, which focuses on health care of elderly people and carried out research, education and practices to promote health in the elderly, are becoming more important. Furthermore, along with a need for multidisciplinary care to support geriatric medicine, the development of a comprehensive education system for aged-care professionals is awaited. Thus, we should now recognize the importance of gerontology and geriatrics, and a reform of medical-care services should be made in order to cope with the coming aged society. Population aging is a global phenomenon. The actions being taken by Japan, the world's most aged society, have been closely watched by the rest of the world. Japan's aged society has been posing not only medical, nursing and welfare problems, but also complex problems closely associated with economy, industry and culture. Therefore, to solve these problems, a macroscopic integration and cooperation among industries, education institutions, administration and community through an interdisciplinary approach including medical science, nursing science, nursing care, study of social welfare, social science, engineering, psychology, economics, religion and ethics should be made. Regarding the promotion of gerontology, the \"Committee for Establishing a Scientific Community for Sustainable Aged Society\" of the Science Council of Japan also prepared a proposal and this was announced on 20 April 2011. 2.\n\n\nCURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS\n(1) Promotion of social participation and contribution of elderly people In Japan, the overall labor force rate is expected to decrease in the near future as a result of the low birth rate and high life expectancy. In contrast, many elderly people, particularly the young-old, have sufficient physical strength to fulfil their job duties and make a social contribution. For these people, a social structure where elderly people can work should be developed through re-educating the elderly and providing various job types. Promotion of social participation and contribution of the elderly is expected to cause a substantial increase in the labor force. Furthermore, it is also expected to contribute to not only the upturn of national economic activity through an increase in total consumption, but also a decrease in the number of elderly people who are likely to be in need of care. Therefore, in order for elderly people to be engaged in various social activities, strategies for developing a social structure for re-education, various employment statuses and employment opportunities should be prepared. However, as the total number of jobs is fixed, consideration should also be given to young workers. (2) Fostering medical specialists for aging Older people often suffer from many diseases, together with geriatric syndromes with multiple etiologies. Signs and symptoms vary according to each individual, and are often atypical; therefore, the patients visit different hospitals and receive many screening tests and prescriptions at the same time. To solve this problem, an effective screening system carried out by a primary-care doctor, and privacy-preserving medical data sharing among hospitals and clinics are needed. In a geriatric clinical setting, health-care professionals should be aware of the physical traits of older people who often develop not only dementia, but also geriatric syndromes, such as depression, falls and urinary incontinence, so that a holistic approach with consideration of nursing care is required. However, the existing Japanese medical education system is not prepared for medical professionals enabled to respond to the aforementioned requirements. Thus, the fostering of medical professionals who can provide comprehensive care - especially for the oldest-old - such as geriatric specialists and medical professionals who understand the principles of elderly care, is urgently needed. (3) Diagnosis of elderly-specific diseases and reform of medical-care services In Japan, the diagnostic system for elderly-specific diseases, including dementia, and reform of medical care services are markedly delayed. The current status concerning diagnosis, care and nursing should be investigated to collect academic data. In order to accumulate evidence for providing safe elderly care and nursing, the promotion of clinical research and a marked expansion of geriatric medical centers with high-level medical services are eagerly awaited. (4) Promotion of home-based care and multidisciplinary care To reduce the length of stay in acute hospitals, to reduce the physical burden of health-care professionals working at acute hospitals and to meet the demand of older people who prefer to remain in their own homes, further promotion of home-based care is needed. In addition, \"multidisciplinary care\" is increasingly needed to meet various demands in the medical care and welfare of the elderly. It is considered important to share countermeasures against the problems of disease prevention, medicine, care and welfare among health-care professionals in medicine, care and welfare, and cooperate by making the best use of health-care professionals' specialties. 3.\n\n\nCONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL\nThe subcommittee for aging, thus, provided the following proposal: 1 Development and promotion of systems that enable elderly people to participate socially and make a contribution using an interdisciplinary approach among the various areas, including nursing science, nursing care, study of social welfare, social science, psychology, economics, religion and ethics, as well as medical sciences; 2 Promotion of gerontology, reform and enhancement of geriatrics in undergraduate, postgraduate and lifelong education; 3 Building geriatric medical centers in each area, and accumulating large-scale evidence of geriatric diseases and geriatrics; and 4 Structural development and promotion of home-based care and multidisciplinary care. Through implementation of the above measures, Japan is expected to function as a successful example for the rest of the world."}

PURPOSE\nTo estimate Swedish experience-based value sets for EQ-5D health states using general population health survey data.\n\n\nMETHODS\nApproximately 45,000 individuals valued their current health status by means of time trade off (TTO) and visual analogue scale (VAS) methods and answered the EQ-5D questionnaire, making it possible to model the association between the experience-based TTO and VAS values and the EQ-5D dimensions and severity levels. The association between TTO and VAS values and the different severity levels of respondents' answers on a self-rated health (SRH) question was assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlmost all dimensions (except usual activity) and severity levels had less impact on TTO valuations compared with the UK study based on hypothetical values. Anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values. TTO and VAS values were consistently related to SRH. The inclusion of age, sex, education and socioeconomic group affected the main effect coefficients and the explanatory power modestly.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA value set for EQ-5D health states based on Swedish valuations has been lacking. Several authors have recently advocated the normative standpoint of using experience-based values. Guidelines of economic evaluation for reimbursement decisions in Sweden recommend the use of experience-based values for QALY calculations. Our results that anxiety/depression had the greatest impact on both TTO and VAS values underline the importance of mental health for individuals' overall HRQoL. Using population surveys is in line with recent thinking on valuing health states and could reduce some of the focusing effects potentially appearing in hypothetical valuation studies."}

Mid-adulthood hypertension was associated with 65% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-2.18) increased dementia risk among women but not men. Onset of hypertension in mid-adulthood predicted 73% higher dementia risk in women (95% CI 1.24-2.40) compared to stable normotensive. There was no evidence that hypertension or changes in hypertension increased dementia risk among men.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThough midlife hypertension was more common in men, it was only associated with dementia risk in women. Sex differences in the timing of dementia risk factors have important implications for brain health and hypertension management."}

Prevalence and cost ratios were calculated to examine the impact of potentially modifiable study comorbid conditions in both populations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of ADOD in the entire sample was 9.4%, and their costs represented 22.8% of the total. In the matched sample, all 15 comorbid conditions chosen for the study were more prevalent and showed higher mean individual costs in beneficiaries with ADOD compared with those without. The ADOD population also had higher costs and prevalence than the non-ADOD population when single comorbid conditions were examined separately. Study conditions with the highest individual cost ratios were urinary tract infections (UTIs), diabetes with complications, and fractures. Study conditions with the highest population cost ratios were fractures, UTIs, and diabetes without complications.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrevalence and costs of all study comorbidities were higher in beneficiaries with ADOD compared with those without.

A total of 138 US community health care practices contributed to the data. Data analysis was conducted from March 2017 to May 2018.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPrimary outcomes were use and dosing of statin therapy according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline by African American or white race. Secondary outcomes included lipid levels and patient-reported beliefs. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the association between race and statin undertreatment, a category combining people who were not taking a statin or those taking a dose intensity lower than recommended.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5689 patients (806 [14.2%] African American) in the PALM registry were eligible for statin therapy. African American individuals were less likely than white individuals to be treated with a statin (570/807 [70.6%] vs 3654/4883 [74.8%]; P = .02). Among those treated, African American patients were less likely than white patients to receive a statin at guideline-recommended intensity (269 [33.3%] vs 2145 [43.9%], respectively; P < .001; relative risk, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.15]; P = .05, after adjustment for demographic and clinical factors). The median (interquartile range) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of patients receiving treatment were higher among African American than white individuals (97.0 [76.0-121.0] mg/dL vs 85.0 [68.0-105.0] mg/dL; P < .001). African American individuals were less likely than white individuals to believe statins were safe (292 [36.2%] vs 2800 [57.3%]; P < .001) or effective (564 [70.0%] vs 3635 [74.4%]; P = .008) and were less likely to trust their clinician (663 [82.3%] vs 4579 [93.8%]; P < .001). Group differences in statin undertreatment were not significant after adjusting for demographic, clinical, and clinician factors, socioeconomic status, and patient beliefs (final adjusted relative risk, 1.03 [95% CI 0.96-1.11]; P = .35).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nAfrican American individuals were less likely to receive guideline-recommended statin therapy.

Each site's researchers coded, analyzed, and extracted key themes from local data. Investigators from all sites synthesized results and identified common themes and differences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThemes clustered in 3 areas (barriers to cardiovascular health, constraints related to multiple roles, and suggestions for effective communications and programs). Barriers spanned individual, social and cultural, and environmental levels; women in particular cited multiple roles (eg, competing demands, lack of self-care). Programmatic suggestions included the following: personal, interactive, social context; information in language that people use; activities built around cultural values and interests; and community orientation. In addition, respondents preferred health-related information from trusted groups (eg, AARP), health care providers (but with noticeable differences of opinion), family and friends, and printed materials.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInterventions to decrease barriers to cardiovascular health are needed; these strategies should include family and community context, small groups, interactive methods, culturally sensitive materials, and trusted information sources.

BACKGROUND\nClinical practice guidelines that help clinicians and patients to understand the magnitude of expected individual risks and benefits would help with patient-centered decision-making and prioritization of care. We assessed the net benefit from taking daily aspirin to estimate the individual and public health implications of a more individualized decision-making approach.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey representing all US persons aged 30 to 85 years with no history of myocardial infarction and applied a Markov model based on randomized evidence and published literature to estimate lifetime effects of aspirin treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We found that treatment benefit varies greatly by an individual's cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Almost all adults have fewer major clinical events on aspirin, but for most, events prevented would be so rare that even a very small distaste for aspirin use would make treatment inappropriate. With minimal dislike of aspirin use (disutility, 0.005 QALY per year), only those with a 10-year cardiac event risk >6.1% would have a net benefit. A disutility of 0.01 QALY moves this benefit cut point to 10.6%. Multiple factors altered the absolute benefit of aspirin, but the strong relationship between CVD risk and magnitude of benefit was robust.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe benefits of aspirin therapy depend substantially on an individual's risk of CVD and adverse treatment effects. Understanding who benefits from aspirin use and how much can help clinicians and patients to develop a more patient-centered approach to preventive therapy."}

This result was also observed for exposure 15-20 years before a diagnosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA robust association between some classes of anticholinergic drugs and future dementia incidence was observed. This could be caused by a class specific effect, or by drugs being used for very early symptoms of dementia. Future research should examine anticholinergic drug classes as opposed to anticholinergic effects intrinsically or summing scales for anticholinergic exposure.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nRegistered to the European Union electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies EUPAS8705."}

Each session included 20 minutes of warm-up, 24 minutes of TCC training, and 10 minutes of cool-down. Exercise intensity was estimated to exceed 70% of maximal heart rate (HRmax).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nBreath-by-breath measurement of cardiorespiratory function was obtained during the incremental exercise of leg cycling. Flexibility of thoracic/lumbar spine was measured by an electronic inclinometer. Percentages of body fat was calculated from biceps and subcapsular skinfolds.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the peak exercise, men in the TCC group showed 19% higher peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in comparison with their sedentary counterparts (26.9 +/- 4.7 mL/kg/min vs 21.8 +/- 3.1 mL/kg/min). Women in the TCC group also showed 18% higher VO2peak than in the sedentary group (20.1 +/- 2.9 mL/kg/ min vs 16.5 +/- 2.0 mL/kg/min). The TCC group also showed higher oxygen uptake at the ventilatory threshold. In addition, the TCC practitioners were characterized by greater flexibility and lower percentage of body fat in comparison with their sedentary counterparts.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is concluded that TCC training has benefits for health-related fitness, and it may be prescribed as a suitable conditioning exercise for the elderly."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo understand if patient-provider race-concordance is associated with improved health outcomes for minorities.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA comprehensive review of published research literature (1980-2008) using MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and CINAHL databases were conducted. Studies were included if they had at least one research question examining the effect of patient-provider race-concordance on minority patients' health outcomes and pertained to minorities in the USA. The database search and data analysis were each independently conducted by two authors. The review was limited to data analysis in tabular and text format. A meta-analysis was not possible due to the discrepancy in methods and outcomes across studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Combined, the studies were based on data from 56,276 patients and only 1,756 providers. Whites/Caucasians (37.6%) and Blacks/African Americans (31.5%), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (13.3%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (4.3%) comprised the majority of the patient sample. The median sample of providers was only 16 for African Americans, 10 for Asians and two for Hispanics. The review presented mixed results. Of the 27 studies, patient-provider race-concordance was associated with positive health outcomes for minorities in only nine studies (33%), while eight studies (30%) found no association of race-concordance with the outcomes studied and 10 (37%) presented mixed findings. Analysis suggested that having a provider of same race did not improve 'receipt of services' for minorities. No clear pattern of findings emerged in the domains of healthcare utilization, patient-provider communication, preference, satisfaction, or perception of respect.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is inconclusive evidence to support that patient-provider race-concordance is associated with positive health outcomes for minorities. Studies were limited to four racial/ethnic groups and generally employed small samples of minorities. Further research is needed to understand what health outcomes may be more sensitive to cultural proximity between patients and providers, and what patient, provider and setting-level variables may moderate or mediate these outcomes."}

OBJECTIVE\nIn a representative sample of the elderly population in a southern European city, we tested the hypothesis that there is an association between general somatic and general psychiatric morbidity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA stratified random sample of 4803 individuals aged > or =55 years was selected for the baseline study in the ZARADEMP Project. The elderly were assessed with standardized Spanish versions of instruments, including the Geriatric Mental State (GMS)-AGECAT. Psychiatric cases were diagnosed according to GMS-AGECAT criteria, and somatic morbidity was documented with the EURODEM Risk Factors Questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGeneral comorbidity clustered in 19.9% of the elderly when hypertension was removed from the somatic conditions category, with 33.5% of the sample remaining free from both somatic and psychiatric illnesses. General comorbidity was associated with age, female gender, and limited education, but did not increase systematically with age. The frequency of psychiatric illness was higher among the somatic cases than among noncases, and the frequency of somatic morbidity among the psychiatric cases was higher than among noncases. This association between somatic and psychiatric morbidity remained statistically significant after controlling for age, gender, and education [odds ratio (OR)=1.61; confidence interval (CI)=1.38-1.88]. Most somatic categories were associated with psychiatric illness, but after adjusting for demographic variables and individual somatic illnesses, the association remained statistically significant only for cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (OR=1.47; CI=1.09-1.98) and thyroid disease (OR=1.67; CI=1.10-2.54).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is the first study to document that there is a positive and statistically significant association between general somatic morbidity and general psychiatric morbidity in the (predominantly) elderly population.

The ergogenic and therapeutic effects of increasing muscle creatine by supplementation are well-recognized. It appears that similar benefits to brain function and cognitive processing may also be achieved with creatine supplementation, however research in this area is more limited, and important knowledge gaps remain. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge about the influence of creatine supplementation on brain function in healthy individuals. It appears that brain creatine is responsive to supplementation, however higher, or more prolonged dosing strategies than those typically used to increase muscle creatine, may be required to elicit an increase in brain creatine. The optimal dosing strategy to induce this response, is currently unknown, and there is an urgent need for studies investigating this. When considering the influence of supplementation strategies on cognitive processes, it appears that creatine is most likely to exert an influence in situations whereby cognitive processes are stressed, e.g. during sleep deprivation, experimental hypoxia, or during the performance of more complex, and thus more cognitively demanding tasks. Evidence exists indicating that increased brain creatine may be effective at reducing the severity of, or enhancing recovery from mild traumatic brain injury, however, only limited data in humans are available to verify this hypothesis, thus representing an exciting area for further research."}

From 1995 to 2000, telephone tests of cognitive function [Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS), delayed recall of the TICS 10-word list, immediate and delayed recall of a short paragraph, a test of verbal fluency, and a digit span backwards test] were administered to the women, who were 70-79 y of age at that time. We used linear and logistic regression models to calculate multivariate-adjusted mean differences in test scores and relative risks of a low score for specific supplement users compared with nonusers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLong-term, current users of vitamin E with vitamin C had significantly better mean performance, as judged by a global score that combined individual test scores, than did women who had never used vitamin E or C (P = 0.03); there was a trend for increasingly higher mean scores with increasing durations of use (P = 0.04). These associations were strongest among women with low dietary intakes of alpha-tocopherol. Benefits were less consistent for women taking vitamin E alone, with no evidence of higher scores with longer durations of use. Use of specific vitamin C supplements alone had little relation to performance on our cognitive tests.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of specific vitamin E supplements, but not specific vitamin C supplements, may be related to modest cognitive benefits in older women."}

The validation sample included 197 subjects (105 women) aged 19-83 y with a BMI of 15.7-36.4. Both samples were of mixed ethnic/racial groups. All underwent whole-body magnetic resonance imaging to quantify SM (dependent variable for multiple regressions) and anthropometric variables (independent variables).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo prediction equations with high practicality and optimal derivation correlations with SM were further investigated to assess agreement and bias by using Bland-Altman plots and validated in separate data sets. Including race as a variable increased R(2) by only 0.1% in men and by 8% in women. For men: SM (kg) = 39.5 + 0.665 body weight (BW; kg) - 0.185 waist circumference (cm) - 0.418 hip circumference (cm) - 0.08 age (y) (derivation: R(2) = 0.76, SEE = 2.7 kg; validation: R(2) = 0.79, SEE = 2.7 kg). Bland-Altman plots showed moderate agreement in both derivation and validation analyses. For women: SM (kg) = 2.89 + 0.255 BW (kg) - 0.175 hip circumference (cm) - 0.038 age (y) + 0.118 height (cm) (derivation: R(2) = 0.58, SEE = 2.2 kg; validation: R(2) = 0.59, SEE = 2.1 kg). Bland-Altman plots had a negative slope, indicating a tendency to overestimate SM among women with smaller muscle mass and to underestimate SM among those with larger muscle mass.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnthropometry predicts SM better in men than in women.

Patients who adhere to preventive therapies may be more likely to engage in a broad spectrum of behaviors consistent with a healthy lifestyle. Because many of these behaviors cannot be measured easily, observational studies of outcomes associated with the long-term use of preventive therapies are subject to the so-called \"healthy user bias.\" To better understand this effect, the authors examined the association between adherence to statin therapy and the use of preventive health services in a Pennsylvania cohort of 20,783 new users of statins between 1996 and 2004. After adjustment for age, gender, and various comorbid conditions, patients who filled two or more prescriptions for a statin during a 1-year ascertainment period were more likely than patients who filled only one prescription to receive prostate-specific antigen tests (hazard ratio (HR)=1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 2.19), fecal occult blood tests (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.53), screening mammograms (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.38), influenza vaccinations (HR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.31), and pneumococcal vaccinations (HR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.83) during follow-up.

Female GPs were more likely to examine female patients than male patients (33% vs. 15%, P < 0.001) and female patients attending female GPs reported better physical health (B = 1.59, P < 0.05, effect size = 0.30).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSome of the associations between patient characteristics and SF-12 physical and/or mental component scores were different for men and women. This finding underlines the importance of considering these factors in the management of chronically-ill patients in general practice. The results suggest that chronically ill women attempting to quit smoking may need more psychological support. More quantitative studies are needed to determine the association between GP gender and patient gender in relation to HRQoL."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relation of social resources and cognitive decline in older adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData are from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, an epidemiologic study of risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other common conditions in a geographically defined population of older persons. The sample consisted of 6,102 non-Hispanic African Americans (61.2%) and whites, aged > or = 65, who underwent up to three interviews during an average of 5.3 years of follow-up. Each interview included administration of four cognitive function tests from which a composite measure of cognition was formed. Social networks were based on the number of children, relatives, and friends seen at least once a month. Social engagement was measured with four items related to social and productive activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher number of social networks and level of social engagement were positively correlated with initial level of cognitive function (networks estimate = 0.003, engagement estimate = 0.060, both p < 0.001). Both resources were also associated with a reduced rate of cognitive decline. A high (90th percentile) number of networks reduced the rate of decline by 39% compared to a low level (10th percentile), and high social engagement reduced decline by 91%. These relations remained after controlling for socioeconomic status, cognitive activity, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and chronic medical conditions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGreater social resources, as defined by social networks and social engagement, are associated with reduced cognitive decline in old age."}

BACKGROUND\nParticipation in cognitively stimulating activities is hypothesized to be associated with risk of AD, but knowledge about this association is limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA biracial community in Chicago was censused, persons aged 65 years and older were asked to participate in an interview, and 6,158 of 7,826 (79%) eligible persons did so. As part of the interview, persons rated current frequency of participation in seven cognitive activities (e.g., reading a newspaper) and nine physical activities (e.g., walking for exercise) from which composite measures of cognitive and physical activity frequency were derived. Four years later, 1,249 of those judged free of AD were sampled for a detailed clinical evaluation of incident disease and 842 (74% of those eligible) participated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe composite measure of cognitive activity ranged from 1.28 to 4.71 (mean 3.30; SD 0.59), with higher scores indicating more frequent activity. A total of 139 persons met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD on clinical evaluation. In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, education, sex, race, and possession of the APOE epsilon4 allele, a one-point increase in cognitive activity score was associated with a 64% reduction in risk of incident AD (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65). By contrast, weekly hours of physical activity (mean 3.5; SD 5.1) was not related to disease risk (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10). Education was associated with risk of AD and a similar trend was present for occupation, but these effects were substantially reduced when cognitive activity was added to the model.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities appears to be associated with risk of AD and may partially explain the association of educational and occupational attainment with disease risk."}

OBJECTIVES\nThis study examined the effects of 14 days of creatine supplementation on the physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT), maximal isometric grip strength (GRIP), sit-to-stand (STS), and body weight (BW) in elderly men and women.\n\n\nDESIGN\nUsing a double blind cross-over design, fifteen men (n = 7) and women (n = 8) (age +/- SD = 74.5 +/- 6.4 yrs) were randomly assigned to either the creatine (CR) (20g.d-1 during week 1 decreasing to 10g.d-1 at week 2) or Placebo (PL) group. After a 4 to 6 week washout period, the subjects were assigned the other treatment.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nTo summarize recent findings and current concepts in the beneficial effects of berry consumption on brain function during aging.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nBerryfruit supplementation has continued to demonstrate efficacy in reversing age-related cognitive decline in animal studies. In terms of the mechanisms behind the effects of berries on the central nervous system, recent studies have demonstrated the bioavailability of berry polyphenols in several animal models. These studies have revealed that flavonoids and polyphenols from berries do accumulate in the brain following long-term consumption. Finally, several compelling studies have revealed that berries can influence cell-signaling cascades both in vivo and in cell culture systems. These studies underscore the developing theory that berries and antioxidant-rich foods may be acting as more than just oxygen radical neutralizers in the aging central nervous system.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nAntioxidant-rich berries consumed in the diet can positively impact learning and memory in the aged animal. This effect on cognition is thought to be due to the direct interaction of berry polyphenols with aging neurons, reducing the impact of stress-related cellular signals and increasing the capacity of neurons to maintain proper functioning during aging."}

Serum insulin was measured in 1991 and participants were grouped based on their insulin levels. Dementia was ascertained in 1991, 1994, and 1996 according to international guidelines. The 2,568 men dementia-free in 1991 were reexamined in 1994 and 1996; 244 new cases of dementia were diagnosed.

OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate whether age-related and experimental reductions in SWS and sleep continuity are associated with increased daytime sleep propensity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAssessment of daytime sleep propensity under baseline conditions and following experimental disruption of SWS. Healthy young (20-30 y, n = 44), middle-aged (40-55 y, n = 35) and older (66-83 y, n = 31) men and women, completed a 2-way parallel group study. After an 8-h baseline sleep episode, subjects were randomized to 2 nights with selective SWS disruption by acoustic stimuli, or without disruption, followed by 1 recovery night. Objective and subjective sleep propensity were assessed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).\n\n\nFINDINGS\nDuring baseline sleep, SWS decreased (P < 0.001) and the number of awakenings increased (P < 0.001) across the 3 age groups. During the baseline day, MSLT values increased across the three age groups (P < 0.0001) with mean values of 8.7 min (SD: 4.5), 11.7 (5.1) and 14.2 (4.1) in the young, middle-aged, and older adults, respectively. KSS values were 3.7 (1.0), 3.2 (0.9), and 3.4 (0.6) (age-group: P = 0.031). Two nights of SWS disruption led to a reduction in MSLT and increase in KSS in all 3 age groups (SWS disruption vs. control: P < 0.05 in all cases).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHealthy aging is associated with a reduction in daytime sleep propensity, sleep continuity, and SWS. In contrast, experimental disruption of SWS leads to an increase in daytime sleep propensity. The age-related decline in SWS and reduction in daytime sleep propensity may reflect a lessening in homeostatic sleep requirement. Healthy older adults without sleep disorders can expect to be less sleepy during the daytime than young adults."}

Follow-up of incident dementia varied between 13.7 to 30.1 years depending on the cohort. People with dementia were identified through linked electronic health records and repeated clinical examinations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring 1.8 million person years at risk, 1143 people with dementia were recorded. The risk of dementia was found to be lower for participants with high compared with low cognitive stimulation at work (crude incidence of dementia per 10 000 person years 4.8 in the high stimulation group and 7.3 in the low stimulation group, age and sex adjusted hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92, heterogeneity in cohort specific estimates I2=0%, P=0.99). This association was robust to additional adjustment for education, risk factors for dementia in adulthood (smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, job strain, obesity, hypertension, and prevalent diabetes at baseline), and cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke) before dementia diagnosis (fully adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98). The risk of dementia was also observed during the first 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.95) and from year 10 onwards (0.79, 0.66 to 0.95) and replicated using a repeated job exposure matrix indicator of cognitive stimulation (hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation increase 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.86). In analysis controlling for multiple testing, higher cognitive stimulation at work was associated with lower levels of proteins that inhibit central nervous system axonogenesis and synaptogenesis: slit homologue 2 (SLIT2, fully adjusted β -0.34, P<0.001), carbohydrate sulfotransferase 12 (CHSTC, fully adjusted β -0.33, P<0.001), and peptidyl-glycine α-amidating monooxygenase (AMD, fully adjusted β -0.32, P<0.001). These proteins were associated with increased dementia risk, with the fully adjusted hazard ratio per 1 SD being 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.28) for SLIT2, 1.13 (1.00 to 1.27) for CHSTC, and 1.04 (0.97 to 1.13) for AMD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe risk of dementia in old age was found to be lower in people with cognitively stimulating jobs than in those with non-stimulating jobs.

Calorie or dietary restriction (CR) has attracted attention because it is the oldest and most robust way to extend rodent life span. The idea that the nutrient sensors, termed sirtuins, might mediate effects of CR was proposed 13 years ago and has been challenged in the intervening years. This review addresses these challenges and draws from a great body of new data in the sirtuin field that shows a systematic redirection of mammalian physiology in response to diet by sirtuins. The prospects for drugs that can deliver at least a subset of the benefits of CR seems very real."}

INTRODUCTION\nIndividuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) broadly exhibit lower cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) compared to cognitively healthy older adults. Other factors, such as increasing age and female sex, are also known to track with lower CRF levels. However, it is unclear how these factors together with AD diagnosis and genetic risk (apolipoprotein e4 ; APOE4) collectively affect CRF.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOur primary objective was to characterize the collective relationship of age, sex, APOE4 carrier status , and cognitive status (nondemented or AD) with two commonly reported CRF outcomes, VO2 max and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES). To interrogate the unique and combined effect of age, sex, APOE4, and cognitive status on CRF, we pooled multiple datasets and tested several statistical models allowing all possible interactions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAD diagnosis was consistently associated with lower maximal CRF, which declined with increasing age. APOE4 was also associated with lower maximal CRF (VO2max), but only in male subjects. Submaximal CRF (OUES) was lower in APOE4 carriers of both sexes, although this difference converged in male subjects with advancing age.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis multi-cohort analysis (n = 304) suggests that APOE4 carrier status and sex are important considerations for studies that evaluate maximal and submaximal CRF."}

Drugs used for nervous system disorders were associated with poorer cognitive performance (antiepileptics, eg, topiramate breasoning(score) -0.65 (95% CI -1.05 to -0.24), bmemory(score) -1.41 (-1.79 to -1.04); antipsychotics, eg, risperidone breaction time(ms) -33 (-46 to -20), negative values indicate poor cognitive performance and vice versa). Drugs used for non-nervous system conditions also showed significant negative association with cognitive score, including those where such an association might have been predicted (antihypertensives, eg, amlodipine breasoning -0.1 (-0.15 to -0.06), bmemory -0.08 (-0.13 to -0.03), breaction time -3 (-5 to -2); antidiabetics, eg, insulin breaction time -13 (-17 to -10)) and others where such an association was a surprising observation (proton pump inhibitors, eg, omeprazole breasoning -0.11 (-0.15 to -0.06), bmemory -0.08 (-0.12 to -0.04), breaction time -5 (-6 to -3); laxatives, eg, contact laxatives breaction time -13 (-19 to -8)).

Some associations may reflect underlying diseases for which the medications were prescribed, although the analysis controlled for the possible effect of diagnosis. Other drugs, whose association cannot be linked to the effect of any disease, may need vigilance for their implications in clinical practice."}

Chromium (Cr) picolinate (CrPic) is a widely used nutritional supplement for optimal insulin function. A relationship among Cr status, diabetes, and associated pathologies has been established. Virtually all trials using CrPic supplementation for subjects with diabetes have demonstrated beneficial effects. Thirteen of 15 clinical studies (including 11 randomized, controlled studies) involving a total of 1,690 subjects (1,505 in CrPic group) reported significant improvement in at least one outcome of glycemic control. All 15 studies showed salutary effects in at least one parameter of diabetes management, including dyslipidemia. Positive outcomes from CrPic supplementation included reduced blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and reduced requirements for hypoglycemic medication. The greater bioavailability of CrPic compared with other forms of Cr (e.g., niacin-bound Cr or CrCl(3)) may explain its comparatively superior efficacy in glycemic and lipidemic control. The pooled data from studies using CrPic supplementation for type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects show substantial reductions in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which equate to a reduced risk for disease complications. Collectively, the data support the safety and therapeutic value of CrPic for the management of cholesterolemia and hyperglycemia in subjects with diabetes."}

BACKGROUND\nRecent studies suggest that trends in cardiovascular risk may result in a decrease in age-specific prevalence of dementia. Studies in rural areas are rare.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo study cohort effects in dementia prevalence and survival of people with dementia in a Swedish rural area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were from the 1995-1998 Nordanstig Project (NP) (n = 303) and the 2001-2003 Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Nordanstig (SNAC-N) (n = 384). Overall 6-year dementia prevalence and mortality in NP and SNAC-N were compared for people 78 years and older. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia occurrence using the NP study population as the reference group. Cox regression models were used to analyze time to death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe crude prevalence of dementia was 21.8% in NP and 17.4% in SNAC-N. When the NP cohort was used as the reference group, the age- and gender-adjusted OR of dementia was 0.71 (95% CI 0.48-1.04) in SNAC-N; the OR was 0.47 (0.24-0.90) for men and 0.88 (0.54-1.44) for women. In the extended model, the OR of dementia was significantly lower in SNAC-N than in the NP cohort as a whole (0.63; 0.39-0.99) and in men (0.34; 0.15-0.79), but not in women (0.81; 0.46-1.44). The Cox regression models indicated that the hazard ratio of dying was lower in the SNAC-N than NP population.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTrends toward a lower prevalence of dementia in high-income countries seem to be evident in this Swedish rural area, at least in men."}

OBJECTIVES\nTo establish the impact of age and sex on primary preventive treatment for cardiovascular disease in a typical primary care population.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross sectional study of anonymised patient records.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nAll 41,250 records of patients aged ≥ 40 registered at 19 general practices in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, were extracted and analysed.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPatients' demographics, risk factors for cardiovascular disease (blood pressure, total cholesterol concentration), and prescriptions for primary preventive drugs were extracted from patients' records. Patients were subdivided into five year age bands up to 85 (patients aged ≥ 85 were analysed as one group) and prescribing trends across the population were assessed by estimating the proportion of patients prescribed with antihypertensive drug or statin drug, or both, in each group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 41,250 records screened in this study, 36,679 (89%) patients did not have a history of cardiovascular disease and therefore could be considered for primary preventive treatment. The proportion receiving antihypertensive drugs increased with age (from 5% (378/6978) aged 40-44 to 57% (621/1092) aged ≥ 85) as did the proportion taking statins up to the age of 74 (from 3% (201/6978) aged 40-44 to 29% (675/2367) aged 70-74). In those aged 75 and above, the odds of a receiving prescription for a statin (relative to the 40-44 age group) decreased with every five year increment in age (odds ratio 12.9 (95% confidence interval 10.8 to 15.3) at age 75-79 to 5.7 (4.6 to 7.2) at age ≥ 85; P<0.001). There were no consistent differences in prescribing trends by sex.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPreviously described undertreatment of women in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease was not observed for primary prevention. Low use of statins in older people highlights the need for a stronger evidence base and clearer guidelines for people aged over 75."}

Survey questions explored respondents' trust in physicians, medical research, and health information sources. We used logistic regression and controlled for covariates to assess effects of race and trust on the use of preventive health services.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 4 types of trust through factor analysis: trust in one's own personal physician, trust in the competence of physicians' care, and trust in formal and informal health information sources. Blacks had significantly less trust in their own physicians and greater trust in informal health information sources than did Whites. Greater trust in one's own physician was associated with utilization of routine checkups, prostate-specific antigen tests, and mammograms, but not with flu shots. Greater trust in informal information sources was associated with utilization of mammograms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTrust in one's own personal physician is associated with utilization of preventive health services.

There has been considerable interest in the use of creatine (Cr) supplementation to treat neurological disorders. However, in contrast to muscle physiology, there are relatively few studies of creatine supplementation in the brain. In this report, we use high-field MR (31)P and (1)H spectroscopic imaging of human brain with a 7-day protocol of oral Cr supplementation to examine its effects on cerebral energetics (phosphocreatine, PCr; ATP) and mitochondrial metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate, NAA; and Cr). We find an increased ratio of PCr/ATP (day 0, 0.80 +/- 0.10; day 7, 0.85 +/- 09), with this change largely due to decreased ATP, from 2.7 +/- 0.3 mM to 2.5 +/- 0.3 mM. The ratio of NAA/Cr also decreased (day 0, 1.32 +/- 0.17; day 7 1.18 +/- 0.13), primarily from increased Cr (9.6 +/- 1.9 to 10.1 +/- 2.0 mM). The Cr-induced changes significantly correlated with the basal state, with the fractional increase in PCr/ATP negatively correlating with the basal PCr/ATP value (R = -0.74, P < 0.001). As NAA is a measure of mitochondrial function, there was also a significant negative correlation between basal NAA concentrations with the fractional change in PCr and ATP. Thus healthy human brain energetics is malleable and shifts with 7 days of Cr supplementation, with the regions of initially low PCr showing the largest increments in PCr. Overall, Cr supplementation appears to improve high-energy phosphate turnover in healthy brain and can result in either a decrease or an increase in high-energy phosphate concentrations."}

Although, better known for its role in inflammation, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) has more recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. This has been, in part, to the discovery of its localization not just in glia, cells that are integral to mediating the inflammatory process in the brain, but also neurons. Several effectors of neuronal NF-κB have been identified, including calcium, inflammatory cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor alpha), and the induction of experimental paradigms thought to reflect learning and memory at the cellular level (i.e., long-term potentiation). NF-κB is also activated after learning and memory formation in vivo. In turn, activation of NF-κB can elicit either suppression or activation of other genes. Studies are only beginning to elucidate the multitude of neuronal gene targets of NF-κB in the normal brain, but research to date has confirmed targets involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell signaling and growth, neurotransmission, redox signaling, and gene regulation. Further, several lines of research confirm dysregulation of NF-κB in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disorder characterized clinically by a profound deficit in the ability to form new memories. AD-related neuropathology includes the characteristic amyloid beta plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangles. Although, such neuropathological findings have been hypothesized to contribute to memory deficits in AD, research has identified perturbations at the cellular and synaptic level that occur even prior to more gross pathologies, including transcriptional dysregulation. Indeed, synaptic disturbances appear to be a significant correlate of cognitive deficits in AD. Given the more recently identified role for NF-κB in memory and synaptic transmission in the normal brain, the expansive network of gene targets of NF-κB, and its dysregulation in AD, a thorough understanding of NF-κB-related signaling in AD is warranted and may have important implications for uncovering treatments for the disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive view of our current understanding of the gene targets of this transcription factor in neurons in the intact brain and provide an overview of studies investigating NF-κB signaling, including its downstream targets, in the AD brain as a means of uncovering the basic physiological mechanisms by which memory becomes fragile in the disease."}

Such factors include, amongst many, inaccuracy, imprecision, bias, failures to follow or lack of operational protocols for applying CT methods, inter-site variance, and lack of homogeneous sampling using disorder criteria. After a review of the literature and survey of a sample of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) CTs, the authors question whether problems of human error preclude AD researchers from continuing their dependence on rated outcome measures for CTs. The authors propose that the realities of AD, especially a probable irreversible progression of neuropathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms or signs capable of differentiating persons at risk for AD from normal aged, require AD investigators and clinicians to privilege biomarkers and encourage their development as surrogate targets for preventive AD treatment developments, testing, and use in clinical practice."}

Genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) are associated with an increase in oxidative stress, suggesting that oxidative stress is involved at an early stage of the pathologic cascade. Moreover, oxidative stress is mechanistically and chronologically associated with other key features of AD, namely, metabolic, mitochondrial, metal, and cell-cycle abnormalities. Contrary to the commonly held notion that pathologic hallmarks of AD signify etiology, several lines of evidence now indicate that aggregation of amyloid-beta and tau is a compensatory response to underlying oxidative stress. Therefore, removal of proteinaceous accumulations may treat the epiphenomenon rather than the disease and may actually enhance oxidative damage. Although some antioxidants have been shown to reduce the incidence of AD, the magnitude of the effect may be modified by individual factors such as genetic predisposition (e.g. apolipoprotein E genotype) and habitual behaviors. Because caloric restriction, exercise, and intellectual activity have been experimentally shown to promote neuronal survival through enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses, a combination of dietary regimen of low total calorie and rich antioxidant nutrients and maintaining physical and intellectual activities may ultimately prove to be one of the most efficacious strategies for AD prevention."}

BACKGROUND/AIMS\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Interestingly, muscle mass (MM) and muscle strength (MS) are related to AD. In addition to the muscle profile, brain atrophy is also a prominent feature of AD. There is substantial evidence showing an association between muscle profile and dementia, but the role of the muscle profile and cerebral cortical atrophy within this association is less well understood. The objective of this study was to determine if there is any association between muscle profile and brain regional volume in AD. A secondary objective was to determine whether this relationship continues as the clinical stage of AD progresses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited 28 patients with probable AD without weakness. We assessed the patients' basic demographic characteristics, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and brain magnetic resonance images. MM was measured using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MS was assessed in Nm/kg with an isokinetic knee extensor using an isokinetic device at an angular velocity of 60°/s. An automatic analysis program was used for brain regional volumetric measurements. Dementia was divided into two stages: mild and moderate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMS was related to left hippocampal volume ratio. After adjusting for age and cognitive status, the relationship remained. MS did not demonstrate any relationship to any brain regional volume ratio in the mild stage; however, in the moderate stage, it was positively related to both the right and the left hippocampal volume ratio.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings imply a shared underlying pathology relating MS and brain volume and suggest cognitive functional declines through the muscle-brain axis. Further longitudinal studies are needed to find possible and related causes of reduced MS and cortical atrophy in patients with dementia."}

Subjects receiving creatine (C and CP) experienced a decrease in 3-MH by 40% compared with an increase of 29% for PLA (P < 0.05) and a reduction in NTx (-27%) versus PLA (+13%; P = 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow-dose creatine combined with protein supplementation increases lean tissue mass and results in a greater relative increase in bench press but not leg press strength. Low-dose creatine reduces muscle protein degradation and bone resorption without increasing formaldehyde production."}

Defect of autophagy is common to many neurodegenerative disorders because it serves as a major degradation pathway for the clearance of various aggregate-prone proteins. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which is recognized as the most important negative regulator of autophagy, is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of mTOR and its dependent autophagy in normal brain during aging remains unknown. Furthermore, caloric restriction (CR) is frequently used as a tool to study mechanisms behind aging and age-associated diseases because CR can prevent age-related diseases and prolong lifespan in several model organisms. Inhibiting mTOR and promoting autophagy activity play roles in aging delayed by CR. However, whether CR can ameliorate age-related cognition deficits by inhibiting mTOR and activate autophagy in hippocampus needs to be further investigated. Here we showed a decline of autophagic degradation in mice hippocampus in correlation with age-dependent cognitive dysfunction, whereas the activity of mTOR and its upstream brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling was decreased with aging. In addition, facilitating the mTOR pathway successfully declines and sustains autophagic degradation with aging in hippocampus by CR treatment and is involved in CR by ameliorating age-related cognitive deficits."}

Fourteen weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in significant increases in all measurements of strength and functional tasks and muscle fiber area for both groups (p <.05). CrM supplementation resulted in significantly greater increases in fat-free mass and total body mass, as compared with placebo (p <.05). The CrM group also showed a greater increase in isometric knee extension strength in men and women, as compared with placebo (p <.05), and also greater gains in isometric dorsiflexion strength (p <.05), but in men only. There was a significant increase in intramuscular total creatine in the CrM group (p <.05). Finally, there were no significant side effects of treatment or exercise training. This study confirms that supervised heavy resistance exercise training can safely increase muscle strength and functional capacity in older adults. The addition of CrM supplementation to the exercise stimulus enhanced the increase in total and fat-free mass, and gains in several indices of isometric muscle strength."}

Therefore, abnormal Cr levels in patient vs. control populations could confound the utility of this metabolite as an internal reference. We quantified Cr levels in 22 healthy controls, 15 acutely manic patients with bipolar disorder and 15 acutely ill patients with schizophrenia using (1)H MRS in the anterior cingulate cortex, and the parieto-occipital cortex at 4 Tesla. Patients with schizophrenia had a statistically significant reduction in Cr levels as compared with controls; bipolar disorder patients showed no difference in Cr as compared with controls. In addition, older age was associated with reductions in Cr in healthy controls, but not in patients with either disorder. These findings indicate that the use of Cr as an internal reference in schizophrenia MRS research is problematic unless Cr levels are shown to be normal in the study population.

The specific CK BB activity and protein carbonyl content were determined in brain extracts of six AD and six age-matched control subjects. CK BB activity per microgram of immunoreactive CK BB protein was lower in AD than in control brain extracts, indicating the presence of inactive CK BB molecules. The analysis of specific protein carbonyl levels in CK BB, performed by two-dimensional fingerprinting of oxidatively modified proteins, identified CK BB as one of the targets of protein oxidation in the AD brain.

BACKGROUND\nAdherence to a Mediterranean diet may improve longevity, but relevant data are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a population-based, prospective investigation involving 22,043 adults in Greece who completed an extensive, validated, food-frequency questionnaire at base line. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed by a 10-point Mediterranean-diet scale that incorporated the salient characteristics of this diet (range of scores, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater adherence). We used proportional-hazards regression to assess the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality, as well as mortality due to coronary heart disease and mortality due to cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index, physical-activity level, and other potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring a median of 44 months of follow-up, there were 275 deaths. A higher degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduction in total mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for death associated with a two-point increment in the Mediterranean-diet score, 0.75 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.87]). An inverse association with greater adherence to this diet was evident for both death due to coronary heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.94]) and death due to cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98]). Associations between individual food groups contributing to the Mediterranean-diet score and total mortality were generally not significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGreater adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a significant reduction in total mortality."}

BACKGROUND\nEnterolignans are important biomarkers of microbiota diversity, with higher levels indicating greater diversity. Diet and inflammation have been shown to play a role in maintaining microbiota diversity. This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) has an impact on levels of urinary enterolignans in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2008. We also carried out construct validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nData came from NHANES 2003-2008. Enterolignans [enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL)] and CRP were assayed from urine and serum specimens, respectively. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores were calculated from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable linear and logistic regression for enterolignans, and logistic regression for CRP.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter multivariable adjustment, higher E-DII scores (i.e., indicating a relatively more pro-inflammatory diet) were associated with lower levels of creatinine-normalized END [beta coefficient (b)DIIquartile4vs1 = - 1.22; 95% CI = - 0.69, - 1.74; Ptrend ≤ 0.001] and ENL (bDIIquartile4vs1 = - 7.80; 95% CI = - 5.33, - 10.26; Ptrend ≤ 0.001).

This study also provided construct validation of the E-DII using CRP in a nationally representative sample. The results indicate that dietary inflammatory potential is associated with urinary enterolignans, a potential marker for microbiota diversity.

This paper reports the results of the application of the contingent valuation method (CVM) to determine a monetary value of informal care. We discuss the current practice in valuing informal care and a theoretical model of the costs and benefits related to the provision of informal care. In addition, we developed a survey in which informal caregivers' willingness to accept (WTA) to provide an additional hour of informal care was elicited. This method is better than normally recommended valuation methods able to capture the heterogeneity and dynamics of informal care. Data were obtained from postal surveys. A total of 153 informal caregivers and 149 care recipients with rheumatoid arthritis returned a completed survey. Informal caregivers reported a mean WTA to provide a hypothetical additional hour of informal care of 9.52 Euro (n=124). Many hypotheses derived from the theoretical model and the literature were supported by the data.CVM is a promising alternative for existing methods like the opportunity cost method and the proxy good method to determine a monetary value of informal care that can be incorporated in the numerator of any economic evaluation."}

Our regression results indicate converting facilities are generally different throughout the pre/postconversion years, suggesting little causal effect of ownership conversions on nursing home performance. Before and after conversion, nursing homes converting from nonprofit to for-profit status generally exhibit deterioration in their performance, while nursing homes converting from for-profit to nonprofit status generally exhibit improvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPolicy makers have expressed concern regarding the implications of ownership conversions for nursing home performance. Our results imply that regulators and policy makers should not only monitor the outcomes of nursing home conversions, but also the targets of these conversions."}

BACKGROUND\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to AD.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine whether several markers of inflammation are associated with cognitive decline in African-American and white well-functioning elders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors studied 3,031 African-American and white men and women (mean age 74 years) enrolled in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) were measured at baseline; cognition was assessed with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive decline was defined as a decline of >5 points.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn age-adjusted analyses, participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 or CRP performed nearly 2 points lower (worse) on baseline and follow-up 3MS (p < 0.001 for all) and declined by almost 1 point over the >2 years (p = 0.01 for IL-6 and p = 0.04 for CRP) compared with those in the lowest tertile. After multivariate adjustment, 3MS scores among participants in the highest tertile of IL-6 and CRP were similar at baseline but remained significantly lower at follow-up (p < or = 0.05 for both). Those in the highest inflammatory marker tertile were also more likely to have cognitive decline compared with the lowest tertile for IL-6 (26 vs 20%; age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.69) and for CRP (24 vs 19%; OR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.79) but not for TNFalpha (23 vs 21%; OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.43). There was no significant interaction between race and inflammatory marker or between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and inflammatory marker on cognition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSerum markers of inflammation, especially IL-6 and CRP, are prospectively associated with cognitive decline in well-functioning elders. These findings support the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to cognitive decline in the elderly."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the association between birth weight and cognitive function in the normal population.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA longitudinal, population based, birth cohort study.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n3900 males and females born in 1946.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nCognitive function from childhood to middle life (measured at ages 8, 11, 15, 26, and 43 years).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBirth weight was significantly and positively associated with cognitive ability at age 8 (with an estimated standard deviation score of 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.59)) between the lowest and highest birthweight categories after sex, father's social class, mother's education, and birth order were controlled for. This association was evident across the normal birthweight range (>2.5 kg) and so was not accounted for exclusively by low birth weight. The association was also observed at ages 11, 15, and 26, and weakly at age 43, although these associations were dependent on the association at age 8. Birth weight was also associated with education, with those of higher birth weight more likely to have achieved higher qualifications, and this effect was accounted for partly by cognitive function at age 8.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBirth weight was associated with cognitive ability at age 8 in the general population, and in the normal birthweight range. The effect at this age largely explains associations between birth weight and cognitive function at subsequent ages. Similarly, the association between birth weight and education was accounted for partly by earlier cognitive scores."}

Thematic analysis of interview transcripts, guided by the integrated behavior model (IBM), identified self-reported motivations for participating in this care-focused and community-promoted research program. Findings revealed that decisions to enroll were influenced by strong instrumental attitudes regarding learning more about personal health and contributing to future care options for others. Notable normative influences that factored into participants' decisions to enroll in the study included hearing about the study from a respected community media outlet, friends, and family. About one-third of respondents discussed past and current racial discrimination in medical research as an important sociocultural frame within which they thought about participation, suggesting that experiential attitudes play a continuing role in AA's decisions to enroll in medical research studies.

Background: Past studies have suggested that higher lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) levels in serum and in the central nervous system (as quantified by measuring macular pigment optical density, MPOD) are related to improved cognitive function in older adults. Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p < 0.04), reasoning ability (p < 0.05) and complex attention (p < 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations."}

The progression rate is inversely proportional to baseline ADAS-Cog. Antidepressants, benzodiazepines, first-generation more than second generation, and most antipsychotics with the exception of aripiprazole worsen the outcome when added to standard-of-care in mild cases. Low dose second-generation benzodiazepines revert the negative effects of risperidone and olanzapine, but only in mild stages. Non APOE4 carriers with a COMTMM and 5HTTLPRLL are predicted to have the best cognitive performance at baseline but deteriorate somewhat faster over time. However, this effect is significantly modulated by comedications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOnce these simulations are validated, the platform can in principle provide optimal treatment guidance in clinical practice at an individual patient level, identify negative pharmacodynamic interactions with novel targets and address protocol amendments in clinical trials."}

Background\nThe study aimed to identify the effects of modeling procedures on bacterial communities and to investigate whether different modeling procedures lead to consistent patterns of gut microbiome compositions.\n\n\nMethods\nTwo irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rat models maternal separation (MS) alone and multiple-early-adversity modeling (MAM) were established and the gut microbiome were analyzed using 16S-rRNA-based high-throughput sequencing methods.\n\n\nResults\nRats from both models exhibited visceral hypersensitivity and the two model groups exhibited differences in the extent of visceral sensitivity and fecal water content. The microbial community structure of the two models exhibited significant differences compared to the controls, while the two model groups also exhibited significant differences between them. Furthermore, microbial community functional predictions suggested that the two models exhibited different abundances of metabolisms and pathways. Several common and distinct characteristic differences were also observed between the two model groups. Alloprevotella were more abundant in both model groups, while Butyricicoccus, Turicibacter, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto along with the family it belongs to were less abundant relative to controls. In addition, the abundance of Clostridium_IV, Corynebacterium, Rothia, Elusimicrobium, Romboutsia, Allobaculum, Parasutterella, and their related taxa were specifically associated with MS group, whereas Butyricimonas and Vampirovibrio along with its related taxa were specifically associated with MAM group. Among those, Butyricimonas, Butyricicoccus and Corynebacterium were found to partially mediate early adversity exposure-induced visceral hypersensitivity.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results highlight the importance in evaluating gut microbiota characteristics in IBS research while also systematically considering potential modeling procedural differences. The microbial compositional/functional differences identified in this study were suggestive to further investigation of mechanisms of early adversity induced IBS."}

Mounting evidence has firmly established that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates attributable to various cancers. A growing body of epidemiological and clinical evidence demonstrates not only that CRF is a potentially stronger predictor of mortality than established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but that the addition of CRF to traditional risk factors significantly improves the reclassification of risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this statement is to review current knowledge related to the association between CRF and health outcomes, increase awareness of the added value of CRF to improve risk prediction, and suggest future directions in research. Although the statement is not intended to be a comprehensive review, critical references that address important advances in the field are highlighted. The underlying premise of this statement is that the addition of CRF for risk classification presents health professionals with unique opportunities to improve patient management and to encourage lifestyle-based strategies designed to reduce cardiovascular risk. These opportunities must be realized to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and hence meet the American Heart Association's 2020 goals."}

BACKGROUND\nTo examine the effect of multicomponent exercise program on memory function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nSubjects were 100 older adults (mean age, 75 years) with MCI. The subjects were classified to an amnestic MCI group (n = 50) with neuroimaging measures, and other MCI group (n = 50) before the randomization. Subjects in each group were randomized to either a multicomponent exercise or an education control group using a ratio of 1∶1. The exercise group exercised for 90 min/d, 2 d/wk, 40 times for 6 months. The exercise program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory. The control group attended two education classes. A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that no group × time interactions on the cognitive tests and brain atrophy in MCI patients. A sub-analysis of amnestic MCI patients for group × time interactions revealed that the exercise group exhibited significantly better Mini-Mental State Examination (p = .04) and logical memory scores (p = .04), and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy (p<.05) compared to the control group. Low total cholesterol levels before the intervention were associated with an improvement of logical memory scores (p<.05), and a higher level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly related to improved ADAS-cog scores (p<.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nThe results suggested that an exercise intervention is beneficial for improving logical memory and maintaining general cognitive function and reducing whole brain cortical atrophy in older adults with amnestic MCI. Low total cholesterol and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor may predict improvement of cognitive functions in older adults with MCI.

Intermittent fasting (IF; reduced meal frequency) and caloric restriction (CR) extend lifespan and increase resistance to age-related diseases in rodents and monkeys and improve the health of overweight humans. Both IF and CR enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity. Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms--reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span."}

BACKGROUND\nIncreasing the proportion of subjects allocated to the experimental treatment in controlled clinical trials is often advocated as a method of increasing recruitment rates and improving the performance of trials. The presumption is that the higher likelihood of randomization to the experimental treatment will be perceived by potential study enrollees as an added benefit of participation and will increase recruitment rates and speed the completion of trials. However, studies with alternative allocation ratios require a larger sample size to maintain statistical power, which may result in a net increase in time required to complete recruitment and a net increase in total trial cost.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo describe the potential net effect of alternative allocation ratios on recruitment time and trial cost.\n\n\nMETHODS\nModels of recruitment time and trial cost were developed and used to compare trials with 1:1 allocation to trials with alternative allocation ratios under a range of per subject costs, per day costs, and enrollment rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn regard to time required to complete recruitment, alternative allocation ratios are net beneficial if the recruitment rate improves by more than about 4% for trials with a 1.5:1 allocation ratio and 12% for trials with a 2:1 allocation ratio. More substantial improvements in recruitment rate, 13 and 47% respectively for scenarios we considered, are required for alternative allocation to be net beneficial in terms of tangible monetary cost.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe cost models were developed expressly for trials comparing proportions or means across treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing alternative allocation ratio designs to improve recruitment may or may not be time and cost-effective. Using alternative allocation for this purpose should only be considered for trial contexts where there is both clear evidence that the alternative design does improve recruitment rates and the attained time or cost efficiency justifies the added study subject burden implied by a larger sample size."}

There was no interaction between race (p = 0.2928) and association of adherence to MeD with cognitive status. However, we identified a strong interaction of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0134) on the relationship of adherence to MeD with ICI; high adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI in nondiabetic participants (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94; p = 0.0066) but not in diabetic individuals (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.95-1.71; p = 0.1063).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigher adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI independent of potential confounders.

AIMS\nA discussion of the existence, prevalence and characteristics of the nocebo effect in health care.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThere is increasing but inconsistent evidence for nocebo effects (the opposite of placebo). Causal mechanisms are believed to be similar to placebo (negative effects result from suggestions of negative clinical outcomes). Risk screening in health care may produce this unintended effect through labelling some patients as high risk. Given health care's almost universal coverage this potentially affects many people.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDiscussion paper following a scoping review of the existence and frequency of nocebo.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nLiterature databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CCTR, CINAHL and EMBASE) searched from inception dates to 2013.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nSignificant empirical evidence indicates that negative beliefs may impact on health outcomes (incidence estimates range from 3-27%). The nocebo effect, rooted in the complex interplay between physiological functioning and social factors, appears significantly more common among women and where prior negative knowledge or expectations exist. Pre-existing psychological characteristics (anxiety, neuroses, panic disorder or pessimism) exacerbate it.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile the placebo effect is well documented, there has been no systematic attempt to synthesize primary empirical research on the role of nocebo. It is possible that nocebo outcomes may be preventable through careful consideration of information provision and the prior identification of potentially high risk individuals. This paper summarizes the scale and importance of the nocebo effect, its distribution according to a range of social and clinical variables and its known relation to psychological precursors. It identifies important gaps in the research literature."}

OBJECTIVES\nThe EQ-5D is a preference-based measure of health and is increasingly being used in the evaluation of health technologies. A 'tariff' of values for all 243 EQ-5D health states has been generated using direct valuations on a subset of these states. The tariff is used to express the value of differences between health states, and so this paper explores whether a tariff with better predictive ability can be calculated using differences between values rather than using the values themselves.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe original tariff (reported in this journal) was based on valuations for 42 EQ-5D states elicited from a representative sample of 2997 members of the UK general population using the time trade-off method. This same data are used to estimate a tariff based upon the differences in value between the worst possible state (33333) and all other states.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA simple model that fits the data well is one in which the differences in value between 33333 and all other states are explained in terms of the change in each dimension plus a term to pick up whether some dimensions change by the maximum amount whereas others do not change at all. The mean absolute difference between the actual values and those predicted by this model is 0.03 (compared with 0.039 in the original model).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe model presented in this paper predicts the difference between 33333 and all other states remarkably well and can be used to generate a tariff for all EQ-5D health states. In fact, this model more accurately predicts the values of states for which there are direct observations, and so we recommend its comparison with the original model in evaluative studies."}

Mild uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is an intrinsic property of all mitochondria and may have evolved to protect cells against the production of damaging reactive oxygen species. Therefore, compounds that enhance mitochondrial uncoupling are potentially attractive anti-aging therapies; however, chronic ingestion is associated with a number of unwanted side effects. We have previously developed a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-directed and promotes oxidation of hepatic triglycerides by causing a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial inefficiency. Here, we sought to leverage the higher therapeutic index of CRMP to test whether mild mitochondrial uncoupling in a liver-directed fashion could reduce oxidative damage and improve age-related metabolic disease and lifespan in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration of CRMP (20 mg/[kg-day] × 4 weeks) reduced hepatic lipid content, protein kinase C epsilon activation, and hepatic insulin resistance in aged (74-week-old) high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J male mice, independently of changes in body weight, whole-body energy expenditure, food intake, or markers of hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis. CRMP treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in hepatic lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and inflammation. Importantly, long-term (49 weeks) hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling initiated late in life (94-104 weeks), in conjugation with HFD feeding, protected mice against neoplastic disorders, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a strain and sex-specific manner. Taken together, these studies illustrate the complex variation of aging and provide important proof-of-concept data to support further studies investigating the use of liver-directed mitochondrial uncouplers to promote healthy aging in humans."}

The availability of more plan options was associated with increased enrollment in Medicare Advantage when elderly Medicare beneficiaries chose from a limited number of plans-for example, fewer than fifteen plans. Enrollment was unchanged or decreased in Medicare Advantage when beneficiaries chose from larger numbers of plans-for example, fifteen to thirty, or more than thirty. Elderly adults with low cognitive function were less responsive to the generosity of available benefits than those with high cognitive function when choosing between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

Sixty elderly (≥ 65 years) diabetic patients were recruited (mean age: 71.1 ± 6.1 years; M/F: 35/25). Endothelial function, evaluated by non-invasive flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, as well as anthropometric and laboratory data, including ionized Mg (Mg-ion), were measured in all patients before and after one-month. Thirty patients underwent oral Mg supplementation with 4.5 g/day of Mg pidolate (368 mg/day of Mg ion), while the rest were used as a control group. The usual management of diabetes and hypertension was not changed during the month of study participation for all the patients. In the group of patients that underwent Mg supplementation, Mg-ion concentration significantly increased from 0.42 ± 0.05 mmol/L to 0.49 ± 0.06 mmol/L; p < 0.05. Mg intervention resulted in a significant improvement of the post-ischemic endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (from 3.3 ± 3.6% to 8.4 ± 3.9%; p < 0.05).

There is epidemiologic and imaging evidence for the presence of cognitive reserve, but the neurophysiologic substrate of CR has not been established. In order to test the hypothesis that CR is related to aspects of neural processing, we used fMRI to image 19 healthy young adults while they performed a nonverbal recognition test. There were two task conditions. A low demand condition required encoding and recognition of single items and a titrated demand condition required the subject to encode and then recognize a larger list of items, with the study list size for each subject adjusted prior to scanning such that recognition accuracy was 75%. We hypothesized that individual differences in cognitive reserve are related to changes in neural activity as subjects moved from the low to the titrated demand task. To test this, we examined the correlation between subjects' fMRI activation and NART scores. This analysis was implemented voxel-wise in a whole brain fMRI dataset. During both the study and test phases of the recognition memory task we noted areas where, across subjects, there were significant positive and negative correlations between change in activation from low to titrated demand and the NART score. These correlations support our hypothesis that neural processing differs across individuals as a function of CR. This differential processing may help explain individual differences in capacity, and may underlie reserve against age-related or other pathologic changes."}

PURPOSE\nTo study the effect of creatine (Cr) supplementation combined with resistance training on muscular performance and body composition in older men.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty men were randomized to receive creatine supplementation (CRE, N = 16, age = 70.4 +/- 1.6 yr) or placebo (PLA, N = 14, age = 71.1 +/- 1.8 yr), using a double blind procedure. Cr supplementation consisted of 0.3-g Cr.kg(-1) body weight for the first 5 d (loading phase) and 0.07-g Cr.kg(-1) body weight thereafter. Both groups participated in resistance training (36 sessions, 3 times per week, 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 12 exercises). Muscular strength was assessed by 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) for leg press (LP), knee extension (KE), and bench press (BP). Muscular endurance was assessed by the maximum number of repetitions over 3 sets (separated by 1-min rest intervals) at an intensity corresponding to 70% baseline 1-RM for BP and 80% baseline 1-RM for the KE and LP. Average power (AP) was assessed using a Biodex isokinetic knee extension/flexion exercise (3 sets of 10 repetitions at 60 degrees.s(-1) separated by 1-min rest). Lean tissue (LTM) and fat mass were assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with PLA, the CRE group had significantly greater increases in LTM (CRE, +3.3 kg; PLA, +1.3 kg), LP 1-RM (CRE, +50.1 kg; PLA +31.3 kg), KE 1-RM (CRE, +14.9 kg; PLA, +10.7 kg), LP endurance (CRE, +47 reps; PLA, +32 reps), KE endurance (CRE, +21 reps; PLA +14 reps), and AP (CRE, +26.7 W; PLA, +18 W).

BACKGROUND\nThe metabolic syndrome is thought to be a contributor to coronary heart disease (CHD), and components of the syndrome have been identified as possible therapeutic targets. Previous data implicate neurohumoral activation related to psychosocial stress as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcendental meditation (TM) on components of the metabolic syndrome and CHD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 weeks of TM or active control treatment (health education), matched for frequency and time, at an academic medical center in a total of 103 subjects with stable CHD. Main outcome measures included blood pressure, lipoprotein profile, and insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (calculated as follows: [(fasting plasma glucose level [in milligrams per deciliter] x fasting plasma insulin level [in microunits per milliliter]) x 0.0552]/22.5); endothelial function measured by brachial artery reactivity testing; and cardiac autonomic system activity measured by heart rate variability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe TM group had beneficial changes (measured as mean +/- SD) in adjusted systolic blood pressure (-3.4 +/- 2.0 vs 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg; P = .04), insulin resistance (-0.75 +/- 2.04 vs 0.52 +/- 2.84; P = .01), and heart rate variability (0.10 +/- 0.17 vs -0.50 +/- 0.17 high-frequency power; P = .07) compared with the health education group, respectively. There was no effect of brachial artery reactivity testing.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of TM for 16 weeks in CHD patients improved blood pressure and insulin resistance components of the metabolic syndrome as well as cardiac autonomic nervous system tone compared with a control group receiving health education. These results suggest that TM may modulate the physiological response to stress and improve CHD risk factors, which may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CHD."}

INTRODUCTION\nIt has been estimated that a 10%-25% reduction in seven key risk factors could potentially prevent 1.1-3.0 million Alzheimer's disease cases globally. In addition, as dementia is preceded by more subtle cognitive deficits which have substantial social and economic impact, effective preventative interventions would likely have more extensive benefits. The current study evaluates in primary care a multidomain risk-reduction intervention targeting adults with high risk of developing dementia.\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted to evaluate three intervention programmes using a pragmatic approach suitable to the clinic: (1) a 12-week online and face-to-face dementia risk-reduction intervention (Body Brain Life-General Practice (BBL-GP)); (2) a 6-week face-to-face group lifestyle modification programme (LMP); and (3) a 12-week email-only programme providing general health information. We aim to recruit 240 participants, aged 18 and over, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline and follow-ups (postintervention, 18, 36 and 62 weeks). The primary outcome is dementia risk measured with the modified version of the Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index Short Form. Secondary outcomes are cognitive function measured with Trails A and B, and the Digit Symbol Modalities Test; physical activity with moderate-vigorous physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; depression with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression; cost evaluation with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score and Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool; diet quality with the Australian Recommended Food Score; and sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThis RCT is a novel pragmatic intervention applied in a primary care setting to reduce the dementia risk exposure in adults at high risk. If successful, BBL-GP and LMP will provide a versatile, evidence-based package that can be easily and quickly rolled out to other primary care settings and which can be scaled up at relatively low cost compared with other strategies involving intensive interventions.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nACTRN12616000868482."}

Prevalence estimates for risk factors were derived from nationally representative cross-sectional survey data collected between 2011 and 2018. Combined PAFs were adjusted for risk factor communality using weights derived from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (1987-2018). Analyses were conducted May through October 2021.\n\n\nExposures\nLow education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and air pollution.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPAF for each dementia risk factor, a combined PAF, and the decrease in the number of prevalent dementia cases in 2020 that would be expected given a 15% proportional decrease in each exposure.\n\n\nResults\nAmong all US adults, an estimated 41.0% (95% CI, 22.7%-55.9%) of dementia cases were attributable to 12 risk factors. A 15% proportional decrease in each risk factor would reduce dementia prevalence in the population by an estimated 7.3% (95% CI, 3.7%-10.9%). The estimated PAF was greater for Black and Hispanic than it was for White and Asian individuals. The greatest attributable fraction of dementia cases was observed for hypertension (PAF, 20.2%; 95% CI, 6.3%-34.4%), obesity (PAF, 20.9%; 95% CI, 13.0%-28.8%), and physical inactivity (PAF, 20.1%; 95% CI, 9.1%-29.6%). These factors were also highest within each racial and ethnic group, although the proportions varied.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nA large fraction of dementia cases in the US were associated with potentially modifiable risk factors, especially for Black and Hispanic individuals.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nEvidence for the benefit of nutrition in Alzheimer's disease continues to accumulate. Many studies with individual vitamins or supplements show marginal, if any, benefit. However, new findings with combinatorial formulations demonstrate improvement in cognitive performance and behavioral difficulties that accompany Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we review some of the most recent clinical advances and summarize supportive preclinical studies.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nWe present novel positive effects on Alzheimer's disease derived from diet, trace elements, vitamins and supplements. We discuss the inherent difficulty in conducting nutritional studies because of the variance in participants' nutritional history, versus pharmacological interventions in which participants are naive to the intervention. We examine the evidence that epigenetics play a role in Alzheimer's disease and how nutritional intervention can modify the key epigenetic events to maintain or improve cognitive performance.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOverall consideration of the most recent collective evidence suggests that the optimal approach for Alzheimer's disease would seem to combine early, multicomponent nutritional approaches (a Mediterranean-style diet, multivitamins and key combinatorial supplements), along with lifestyle modifications such as social activity and mental and physical exercise, with ultimate addition of pharmacological agents when warranted."}

Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58 ± 0.62, p = 0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31 ± 0.61, p = 0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r = 0.49, p = 0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r = -0.44, p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability.

BACKGROUND\nThe role of cognitive reserve (CR) to explain individual differences in cognitive functioning is unclear in memory clinic patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the cross-sectional effect of CR on cognition in relation to levels of neurodegeneration in a large elderly single-center memory clinic population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, n = 481), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 628) or Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 1,099). Education was used as proxy for CR and visually rated medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on CT was used as parameter of neurodegeneration. Relations between CR, cognition, and MTA were analyzed with multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and cerebral atrophy. In addition, we examined if education affects the relation between MTA and cognition using an interaction variable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEducation was significantly related to all measures of cognition including subtests with an explained variance of education as a determinant of cognition of 11%. More highly educated patients had more advanced levels of MTA at the same level of cognition. All these results were stronger or only present in demented compared to non-demented patients but appeared no longer significant in those with lowest overall cognition. The interaction effect was significant indicating that with more advanced MTA, less cognitive decline was shown in higher educated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEducation is a very strong determinant of cognition in an elderly memory clinic population. The positive effect of education was stronger in demented than in non-demented patients but disappeared in those with the lowest cognitive scores indicating a \"window of CR benefit\"."}

OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether there are differences in age and sex distribution and presence of comorbidities between participants included in randomized controlled trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and nationwide cohort of persons with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original articles from their inception to January 4, 2015. Double-blind randomized controlled trials with donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine compared to placebo in participants with Alzheimer's disease were included. Data from a nationwide cohort of persons with clinically verified diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease was defined as a reference population.\n\n\nRESULTS\n128 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, 31 of them fulfilled criteria. Mean age of participants in randomized controlled trials (n = 15,032) was 5.8 years lower (95% CI 5.7 to 5.9, P < 0.001), compared to the mean age of 79.7 years in the reference population with Alzheimer's disease (n = 28,093).

BACKGROUND\nThe Mediterranean diet has long been reported to be protective against the occurrence of several different health outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to update our previous meta-analysis of published cohort prospective studies that investigated the effects of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on health status.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search through electronic databases up to June 2010.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe updated review process showed 7 prospective studies published in the past 2 y that were not included in the previous meta-analysis (1 study for overall mortality, 3 studies for cardiovascular incidence or mortality, 1 study for cancer incidence or mortality, and 2 studies for neurodegenerative diseases). These recent studies included 2 health outcomes not previously investigated (ie, mild cognitive impairment and stroke). The meta-analysis for all studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94). The meta-regression analysis showed that sample size was the most significant contributor to the model because it significantly influenced the estimate of the association for overall mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis updated meta-analysis confirms, in a larger number of subjects and studies, the significant and consistent protection provided by adherence to the Mediterranean diet in relation to the occurrence of major chronic degenerative diseases."}

BACKGROUND\nThe proportion of European elderly is expected to increase to 30% in 2060. Combining dietary components may modulate many processes involved in ageing. So, it is likely that a healthful diet approach might have greater favourable impact on age-related decline than individual dietary components. This paper describes the design of a healthful diet intervention on inflammageing and its consequences in the elderly.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe NU-AGE study is a parallel randomized one-year trial in 1250 apparently healthy, independently living European participants aged 65-80 years. Participants are randomised into either the diet group or control group. Participants in the diet group received dietary advice aimed at meeting the nutritional requirements of the ageing population. Special attention was paid to nutrients that may be inadequate or limiting in diets of elderly, such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, and calcium. C-reactive protein is measured as primary outcome.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe NU-AGE study is the first dietary intervention investigating the effect of a healthful diet providing targeted nutritional recommendations for optimal health and quality of life in apparently healthy European elderly. Results of this intervention will provide evidence on the effect of a healthful diet on the prevention of age related decline."}

Physical frailty was defined on the basis of slow gait speed and inability to stand from a chair with one's arms folded.\n\n\nSETTING\nGeneral community in greater Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nCommunity-living persons, age 75 and older, who met criteria for physical frailty.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nMeasures of efficiency included the number of persons screened for each participant randomized, the number of persons eligible for each participant randomized, and the refusal rate. Costs were calculated per randomized participant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred eighty-eight participants, with a mean age of 83.2 years, were enrolled over 22 months.

Outcome variables included \"healthy\" life span, neurobehavioral phenotyping, as well as morphology, biochemistry, and expression profiling from brain. The median healthy life span of Cr-fed mice was 9% higher than in control mice, and they performed significantly better in neurobehavioral tests. In brains of Cr-treated mice, there was a trend towards a reduction of reactive oxygen species and significantly lower accumulation of the \"aging pigment\" lipofuscin.

With this rapid rise comes an increased prevalence of diseases of ageing and associated healthcare expenditure. To address the health consequences of global ageing, research in model systems (worms, flies and mice) has indicated that reducing the rate of organ growth, via reductions in protein synthetic rates, has multi-organ health benefits that collectively lead to improvements in lifespan. In contrast, human pre-clinical, clinical and large cohort prospective studies demonstrate that ageing leads to anabolic (i.e. growth) impairments in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to reductions in muscle mass and strength, factors directly associated with mortality rates in the elderly. As such, increasing muscle protein synthesis via exercise or protein-based nutrition maintains a strong, healthy muscle mass, which in turn leads to improved health, independence and functionality. The aim of this review is to critique current literature relating to the maintenance of muscle mass across lifespan and discuss whether maintaining or reducing protein synthesis is the most logical approach to support musculoskeletal function and by extension healthy human ageing."}

In both cohorts there were associations between father's occupation and childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation, a pattern that was mirrored by the associations between childhood cognition, educational attainment and own occupation to adult literacy and numeracy problems. Positive associations between childhood cognition and educational attainment, and between educational attainment and own occupation, were stronger in the 1946 cohort than in the 1958 cohort. However, inverse associations between educational attainment and literacy and numeracy problems were stronger in the 1958 cohort, possibly reflecting the expansion of secondary education in the intervening years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiteracy and numeracy problems have a robust structure of life course associations, although the changing pattern of these associations may reflect important social structural changes from the early post-war years to the early 1960s in the UK."}

If data were represented in graphs, a pair of authors extracted the data points individually, then compared and averaged values.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nThe data were synthesized using a meta-analysis based on cue type. Auditory cueing demonstrated significant improvement of cadence (Hedge g=.556; 95% confidence interval [CI], .291-.893), stride length (Hedge g=.497; 95% CI, .289-.696), and velocity (Hedge g=.544; 95% CI, .294-.795). In contrast, visual cueing significantly improved stride length only (Hedge g=.554; 95% CI, .072-1.036).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that auditory cueing is more effective for treating gait disorders in PD. Further research is needed to determine the optimum auditory cueing strategy for gait improvements."}

BACKGROUND\nImproving cardiovascular health possibly decreases the risk of dementia. Primary care practices offer a suitable setting for monitoring and controlling cardiovascular risk factors in the older population. The purpose of the study is to examine the association of a cardiovascular health metric including six behaviors and blood parameters with the risk of dementia in primary care patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants (N = 3547) were insurants aged ≥55 of the largest German statutory health insurance company, who were enrolled in a six-year prospective population-based study. Smoking, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose were assessed by general practitioners at routine examinations. Using recommended cut-offs for each factor, the patients' cardiovascular health was classified as ideal, moderate, or poor. Behaviors and blood parameters sub-scores, as well as a total score, were calculated. Dementia diagnoses were retrieved from health insurance claims data. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the course of the study 296 new cases of dementia occurred. Adjusted for age, sex, and education, current smoking (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.09-2.85), moderate (1.38, 1.05-1.81) or poor (1.81, 1.32-2.47) levels of physical activity, and poor fasting glucose levels (1.43, 1.02-2.02) were associated with an increased risk of dementia. Body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol were not associated with dementia. Separate summary scores for behaviors and blood values, as well as a total score showed no association with dementia. Sensitivity analyses with differently defined endpoints led to similar results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDue to complex relationships of body-mass index and blood pressure with dementia individual components cancelled each other out and rendered the sum-scores meaningless for the prediction of dementia."}

Cases were evaluated at the individual level within the context of 31 communities (one center encompassed two separate geographical regions). Multivariate analysis was used to determine the significance of individual variables on medication use. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks were less likely to use AChEI and memantine with odds ratios (OR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76) and 0.43 (95% CI 0.32-0.57), respectively. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Black Hispanics were less likely to use memantine (OR=0.69 (95% CI 0.49-0.98)). No association was found between the proportion of Blacks or non-Black Hispanics versus non-Hispanic Whites at an Alzheimer Disease Center and individual use of AChEI or memantine. Other significant variables include gender, age, marital status, dementia severity, source of referral, AChEI use, and education. Education and age somewhat mitigated disparity. Significant racial and ethnic differences in AChEI and memantine use exist at the individual level regardless of the racial and ethnic composition of the individual's community.

After nearly a century of rigorous investigation and testing, dietary caloric restriction (CR) remains the most robust and reproducible method for slowing aging and maintaining health, function, and vitality.

To overcome these issues, we initiated the field of CR mimetics in 1998 and have observed its development into a full-fledged antiaging industry. Basically, strategies that enable individuals to obtain the biological benefits of CR without reducing actual food intake can be considered CR mimetics, whether functional, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, or other. Some of the best known candidates include resveratrol and related agents, the antidiabetic drug metformin, and rapamycin and other mTOR regulators. While the mechanisms of action vary, these and essentially all CR mimetic candidates work through at least some of the same pathways as actual CR. While the entire field continues to evolve rapidly, the current status will be reviewed here, with particular focus on recent developments, the most practical relevance and applicability for potential consumers, and new strategies for the future."}

We describe a novel process for transforming the efficiency of partial expected value of sample information (EVSI) computation in decision models. Traditional EVSI computation begins with Monte Carlo sampling to produce new simulated data-sets with a specified sample size. Each data-set is synthesised with prior information to give posterior distributions for model parameters, either via analytic formulae or a further Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A further 'inner level' Monte Carlo sampling then quantifies the effect of the simulated data on the decision. This paper describes a novel form of Bayesian Laplace approximation, which can be replace both the Bayesian updating and the inner Monte Carlo sampling to compute the posterior expectation of a function. We compare the accuracy of EVSI estimates in two case study cost-effectiveness models using 1st and 2nd order versions of our approximation formula, the approximation of Tierney and Kadane, and traditional Monte Carlo. Computational efficiency gains depend on the complexity of the net benefit functions, the number of inner level Monte Carlo samples used, and the requirement or otherwise for MCMC methods to produce the posterior distributions. This methodology provides a new and valuable approach for EVSI computation in health economic decision models and potential wider benefits in many fields requiring Bayesian approximation."}

BACKGROUND\nStudies examining whether genetic risk information about common, complex diseases can motivate individuals to improve health behaviors and advance planning have shown mixed results. Examining the influence of different study recruitment strategies may help reconcile inconsistencies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSecondary analyses were conducted on data from the REVEAL study, a series of randomized clinical trials examining the impact of genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested whether self-referred participants (SRPs) were more likely than actively recruited participants (ARPs) to report health behavior and advance planning changes after AD risk and APOE genotype disclosure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 795 participants with known recruitment status, 546 (69%) were self-referred and 249 (31%) had been actively recruited. SRPs were younger, less likely to identify as African American, had higher household incomes, and were more attentive to AD than ARPs (all P < 0.01). They also dropped out of the study before genetic risk disclosure less frequently (26% versus 41%, P < 0.001). Cohorts did not differ in their likelihood of reporting a change to at least one health behavior 6 weeks and 12 months after genetic risk disclosure, nor in intentions to change at least one behavior in the future. However, interaction effects were observed where ε4-positive SRPs were more likely than ε4-negative SRPs to report changes specifically to mental activities (38% vs 19%, p < 0.001) and diets (21% vs 12%, p = 0.016) six weeks post-disclosure, whereas differences between ε4-positive and ε4-negative ARPs were not evident for mental activities (15% vs 21%, p = 0.413) or diets (8% versus 16%, P = 0.190). Similarly, ε4-positive participants were more likely than ε4-negative participants to report intentions to change long-term care insurance among SRPs (20% vs 5%, p < 0.001), but not ARPs (5% versus 9%, P = 0.365).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIndividuals who proactively seek AD genetic risk assessment are more likely to undergo testing and use results to inform behavior changes than those who respond to genetic testing offers. These results demonstrate how the behavioral impact of genetic risk information may vary according to the models by which services are provided, and suggest that how participants are recruited into translational genomics research can influence findings.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00089882 and NCT00462917."}

Cognitive performance, clinical diagnosis of dementia, and caffeine consumption were evaluated at baseline and at 2 and 4 year follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCaffeine consumption is associated with a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables which may also affect cognitive decline. Multivariate mixed models and multivariate adjusted logistic regression indicated that women with high rates of caffeine consumption (over three cups per day) showed less decline in verbal retrieval (OR = 0.67, CI = 0.53, 0.85), and to a lesser extent in visuospatial memory (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.65, 1.03) over 4 years than women consuming one cup or less. The protective effect of caffeine was observed to increase with age (OR = 0.73, CI = 0.53, 1.02 in the age range 65 to 74; OR = 0.3, CI = 0.14, 0.63 in the range 80+). No relation was found between caffeine intake and cognitive decline in men. Caffeine consumption did not reduce dementia risk over 4 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe psychostimulant properties of caffeine appear to reduce cognitive decline in women without dementia, especially at higher ages. Although no impact is observed on dementia incidence, further studies are required to ascertain whether caffeine may nonetheless be of potential use in prolonging the period of mild cognitive impairment in women prior to a diagnosis of dementia."}

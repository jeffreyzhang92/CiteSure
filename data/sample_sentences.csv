0,in the absence of sorl1 app fails to be transported out of the endosome and this leads to an increase in generation of aβ in induced pluripotent stem cell ipscderived neurons loss of sorl1 leads to impaired endosomal trafficking and autophagy and ultimately increased aβ levels consistent with these findings loss of sorl1 in ad mouse models leads to an increase in aβ levels in the brain,[16174740 27638701 32492427 34133918 19036982],singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps at the sorl1 locus are associated with ad in genomewide association studies gwass importantly several sorl1 coding variants have been identified in a subset of patients with earlyonset alzheimers disease eoad and variants leading to premature termination codons are found exclusively in alzheimers disease ad cases further reduced expression of sorl1 has been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid csf and postmortem brain of individuals with lateonset ad together these data suggest that sorl1 plays a causal role in ad sorl1 has a major role in intracellular trafficking of various cargos including amyloid precursor protein app which is mediated in part through its role in retromer complexmediated trafficking reviewed in small and gandy,[24162737 35379992 30009200 28537274 15313836 19364929 33667416 17015224]
1,the first compound quercetin is found to have antiinflammatory antiobesity  and cardioprotective action in cardiovascular diseases 53 and antioxidant properties 54 antiarthritic effect 55 antihypertensive effect 56 anticancer properties 57 antidiabetic effects 57 antiallergic effects  and so on,[34101925 29966915 28342364 19307694 27589790 27589790 34101925],"this study reveals the high affinity of quercetin and myricetin towards ache as depicted by their binding energies of -10.6 and -10.5 kcal/mol, respectively, as well as alpha-amyrin and beta-chlorogenin towards buche as depicted by their binding energies of -12.1 and -11.2 kcal/mol, respectively. in contrast, the donepezil revealed the affinity -7.6 kcal/mol with ache protein and -9.8 kcal/mol with buche protein which indicates the lower affinity than spice plant phytochemicals.",[]
2,extracellular circulating mirnas have been investigated as potential biomarkers for ad diagnosis in various studies given their recognized significance in neuronal function and survival,[31659197 36835108 29738527 24827165 36941055],"to date, in tear fluid, approximately 300 different mirnas have been isolated. among these some are newly discovered and their regulatory roles remain relatively unexplored",[31659197 36835108]
